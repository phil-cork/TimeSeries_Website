    "text": "To better understand Magic the Gathering player behavior and sentiment as a proxy for Hasbro’s financial performance, this project draws data from three sources: an open source repository of Magic card prices from the largest online secondary market, Reddit’s API for accessing posts and comments in relevant Magic communities, and Hasbro’s stock performance.\n\nMagicJSON\nTo track the secondary market for Magic cards in which stores and players sell cards, this open source project collects pricing data for popular Magic products and cards over the last ninety days. In this case, we use two databases. First, the pricing data, which we filter to only include data for printed cards and track prices for TCGPlayer, the largest online secondary market outlet. We then store the price for each card style (whether it is printed in a more rare foil treatment or not) over the included timeframe. This pricing database is then connected to the card database to gather data about the rarity and functionality of each card. Code for processing price data is available on Github. Documentation for the MagicJSON project can be accessed through their developer website.\nAs depicted below, the large majority of Magic cards are worth less than $10. However, there are 10,534 printings worth more than $10, with 1024 printings worth more than $100, and 50 printings with an average price over $1000. This context will set the stage for comparing card prices to consumer sentiment and Hasbro’s performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Subreddit Posts\nTo evaluate the changing mood and documented concerns of Magic players and collectors, we gather posts and comments from popular discussions in various Magic communities across Reddit. Reddit is a forum-based social media platform in which users self-select into ‘subreddits’ based on their interests. There are a number of Magic the Gathering subreddits related to different aspects of the game. For this analysis, we consider two different communities:\n\nr/magicTCG - The broadest Magic community which often features previews of new cards, breaking news, and opinion pieces written by fans regarding the game, particular cards or decks, or new playstyles.\nr/mtgfinance - The largest Magic community that is primarily focused on collecting or investing in Magic products. Discussions often include speculative investments, commentary on price changes in various products, and metrics of product performance over time.\n\nThis dataset includes the contents of the post and comments and associated meta-data. The meta-data provides context like how many upvotes the post received, when it was posted, the type of post (image, text, link), and other details.\nCode for accessing and processing this text data is available on Github. Access to the Reddit API is done through the Python package, PRAW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHasbro Stock Prices\nTo determine how Magic the Gathering influences Hasbro’s performance, the above data will be compared to the changes in stock prices and valuation metrics for Hasbro over the last months.\nThis data is collected through Yahoo! finance."

    "text": "Hasbro’s stock has fallen sharply in recent months after mainstream news outlets accused the company of killing their “golden goose” by overproducing and overcharging for Magic the Gathering products. Fans of Magic the Gathering, however, had expressed these same frustrations for months before journalists and news pundits caught on. Is it possible that by better understanding the sentiment and behavior of Magic players, investors could have predicted this downturn sooner?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHasbro\nHasbro is a United States-based, multinational conglomerate that owns the trademarks for a number of prominent toy and entertainment subsidiaries such as Milton Bradley, Tonka, Playskool, Parker Brothers and others. Their range of toy, game, and entertainment products include Nerf, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Monopoly, My Little Pony, and dozens of other brands. Chief among Hasbro’s subsidiaries is Wizards of the Coast, the company responsible for the Dungeons & Dragons and Magic the Gathering brands. This project analyzes the Magic the Gathering trading card game as a proxy to better understand and potentially forecast Hasbro’s financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic the Gathering\nMagic the Gathering is a trading card game in which two or more players utilize their custom-tailored deck of cards that represent spells and creatures to battle one another. The game was first released by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and was the first trading card game of its kind, soon to be followed by similar games like Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh. As of April 2022, the game had approximately 35 million players. Between 2008 and 2016, when the game saw an explosive growth in popularity, more than twenty billion Magic cards were manufactured. As of January 2023, there are more than 25,650 unique Magic cards.\nMagic the Gathering is a valuable tool for thinking about Hasbro’s value in three ways. First, Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) has become an increasingly important subsidiary to its parent company. While other subsidiaries are losing money, Hasbro’s reported record growth from Wizards of the Coast. Second, because Magic the Gathering is a competitive trading card game, there is an open market where cards purchased from WOTC are sold by consumers. This secondary market helps explain Magic’s performance in more precise financial outcomes. Finally, Hasbro has been in the financial news lately due to some questionable Magic the Gathering product decisions made in the last year, so it is a both timely and relevant consideration.\n\n\nProject Overview\nMore specifically, this project leverages product pricing data on the secondary market and sentiment analysis of social media posts by Magic the Gathering fans to better understand and potentially forecast the performance of the brand and its parent company, Hasbro.\nSince this endeavor is fairly open-ended, ten questions will guide the analysis:\n\nHow has Hasbro's stock changed over time?\nWhat management and product decisions have influence Hasbro’s stock price in recent years?\nHow does this compare to their biggest competitor, Mattel?\nHow much of Hasbro’s success depends on Wizards of the Coast and its brands?\nHow have Magic the Gathering cards on the secondary market changed in price over time?\nHow have Magic the Gathering sealed products on the secondary market changed in price over time?\nHow has the sentiment of the Magic the Gathering community changed over time?\nAre different Magic the Gathering community subgroups responding differently?\nCan we predict the price of Hasbro stock based on Magic the Gathering community sentiment?\nIs there a lag between Magic the Gathering product performance and Hasbro stock price changes?"

    "text": "Data Visualization with Stock Data\nIn this example, we consider the daily stock prices for Facebook (now META) and Twitter starting in early 2021. Both social media companies have experienced tumultuous years for reasons related to their leadership and vision. Below we compare their stock performance over the last two years in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nMeta and Twitter Stock Prices, Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most striking observation from this plot is the steep and sudden decline of META’s stock price in early 2022. This trend was predominantly a response by investors to Facebook’s admission to playing catch up with TikTok and struggling to develop workarounds for serving ads following Apple’s iOS privacy updates. META’s financial performance further deteriorated following the revelations regarding the massive amount of resources allocated towards research and propping up the metaverse to little consumer excitement or internal use. The fact that Meta was at one point worth twice as much as Twitter only for the two to eventually flip positions enforces the lack of confidence in Facebook’s parent company.\nLikewise, Twitter’s financial performance has not been stellar either. The acquisition and subsequent takeover of the company by Elon Musk created no shortage of controversial headlines, dramatic policy changes, and a series of layoffs across the company. We can observe the responses to these developments in more detail through the interactive visualization below.\n\n\nMeta and Twitter Stock Prices, Interactive Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive tool-tips further highlight the struggles these companies have faced. In early February 2022, META dropped by 26%, its worst day in the market to date. Over the course of early 2022, Twitter experienced similar, but more gradual, losses, sliding from almost $200/share to $119/share before it’s gradual ascent. Of course, these graphs only depict two years of data, most of which were heavily impacted by a number of extraneous factors including the COVID-19 pandemic and global inflation, but these trends are still worth exploring to see how the respective management and vision for these companies has shaped their financial outlook.\n\n\n\nData Visualization with Cryptocurrency Data\n\nEthereum Value\nSimilar to traditional stock prices, we can also examine the value of various cryptocurrencies in a similar manner. Here we consider Ethereum, the second most popular option behind Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Value, Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the initial line plot, we observe the substantial collapse of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included. While activity and confidence rose to new all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2021, the value dropped starkly over the course of the following year, finding a floor near $1000 in the summer before recovering slightly.\n\n\nEthereum Value, Interactive Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the interactive tool-tip, we can observe in finer detail the tumultuous slide in value that took place over the last fifteen months. In November 2021, Ethereum hit an all-time high of $4812, but had fallen to $993 by June 2022. In the last two quarters, the cryptocurrency has gone on several runs, even doubling in value from the low in June to August 2022. These gains have not remained steady, however, with each subsequent rise in value showing less favorable momentum.\nIf we examine only the last thirty days in a candlestick plot, however, we see perhaps a more cautiously optimistic picture, particularly for short-term investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the start of the year, ETH-USD has only closed down four days and has risen in value by 25%. These positive interpretations must of course be dampened when placed in the broader context described above, but this representation highlights the volatility and opportunity for investors who bet on cryptocurrencies, which tend to be more volatile in both the gains and losses than traditional investment instruments.\n\n\n\nClimate Data\nTime series are also frequently used in analyzing weather and climate data given the inherent seasonality and drastic changes that can be observed over time. In this example, we look at temperature recordings from the National Arboretum in Washington D.C. across most of 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first trend that jumps out from the visualization is the expected seasonality in which temperatures generally rise through spring and summer and taper off through fall into winter. The observed temperatures, those recorded at the National Arboretum itself, seem to trend towards the low end of the daily temperature spectrum. This pattern could be due to observations being recorded earlier in the morning when temperatures tend to be lower or perhaps the National Arboretum’s location lends itself to cooler temperatures relative to the rest of the district. Finally, we note variety in the range of the lows and highs themselves, sometimes being only four or five degrees apart and on other days having a range of more than twenty degrees."
