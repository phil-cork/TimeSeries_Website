In 2019, Hasbro's stock rose sharply, growing by 50% from \\~\\$80 in the first quarter to \\~\\$120 in the third before correcting back to \\~\\$100, where it hovered until March 2020 and the lockdown protocols in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though Hasbro quickly recovered from the initial collapse to \\~\\$40, it took the rest of 2020 to return to pre-pandemic prices. The stock was comparatively static throughout 2021, hovering between \\$90 and \\$100 with its largest dip and subsequent rise in the third quarter. 2022, however, proved to be a much more tumultuous year for Hasbro and its subsidiaries.\n\nWith this summary in mind, we take a closer look at the Hasbro stock data and transform it into a more useful format so we can use it later on for modeling and forecasting.\n\n###  Lag Plots\n\nAs a first step in our analysis, we examine how correlation between one day's stock price and another influences the trend of the data series. To better understand the correlation and seasonality that may be present in the stock data, we consider a subset of lagged timeframes.\n\n```{r}\ngglagplot(Hasbro, do.lines=FALSE, lags=16) + \n  labs(title=\"Hasbro Stock Lags\") + theme_minimal()\n```\n\nIn this plot, each lag represents how well one day's stock price correlates with the stock price a number of days later. Over the next two weeks, the trend remains roughly linear and correlated. This pattern deteriorates further with each subsequent day. This distortion is to be expected, as many extraneous factors impact the stock. Thus, a given day's price has less and less influence on a future price. To further test this observation, we also plot lags that are a week apart over the next ten weeks.\n\n```{r}\nts_lags(Hasbro, lags=c(1,7,14,21,28,35,42,48,56,63,70,77))\n```\n\nAgain, the further the lag moves from the original value, the less correlation exists. By week six, the data points look more like a blob of random points than the linear, positive correlation of the previous plot. This pattern also suggests a lack of seasonality in the series as well. We explore this observation in more detail by decomposing the series into its additive components.\n\n###  Decomposition\n\nWe decompose the stock price data to see how the overall trend, seasonality, and random noise uniquely impact the value over time. We observe that Hasbro stock data is additive and deconstruct it using the appropriate parameter, because there is not a change in magnitude of seasonal variance as the trend moves or changes over time.\n\n```{r}\nfit <- Hasbro %>%\n  stl(t.window=51, s.window=\"periodic\", robust=TRUE) \n\nfit %>% autoplot()+ggtitle(\"Hasbro Stock Prices, Time Series Decomposition\") + theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThe trend is the strongest component in the decomposition. The plot depicts a sense of seasonality with the uniform oscillating waves, but the range of the y-axis only goes from -10 to 10, implying the impact of this pattern is less influential on the stock's overall performance, particularly when compared to the randomness shown in the residuals, which swings \\$15 in either direction.\n\nIt is also worth noting the market-wide collapse during COVID-19 lock-down protocols seems to have a strong influence on the seasonal component of the model. The model builds in a larger-than-realistic dip into subsequent repetitions of the seasonal pattern as a result. To compensate, it also includes larger spikes in the residual values to compensate to match the original data and fit the decomposed trend.\n\nCollectively, these observations present a logical set of observations. The long-term trends, both positive and negative, are responsible for the largest component of Hasbro's stock price movement. Seasonality, in its raw component, has a smaller bearing that likely mirrors the cyclical rise and fall of the market as a whole. The residuals, which account for everything else, can be seen as a sort of \"momentum\" of the trend's movements where the intensity of investor confidence or doubt can drive the stock's price to more extreme values than only the trend or the seasonality would suggest.\n\n###  Autocorrelation\n\nIn addition to understanding how the time series can be split into its various components, it's important to understand the autocorrelation in the series. Autocorrelation is simply how much values within the time series are correlated with each other. Autocorrelation is common in time series data because the values have an inherent order and are often similar to one another when they are in close proximity. This premise holds true with our stock data, where one day's closing price is often, but not always, fairly close to the previous and next day's closing price. Hence these values would be highly correlated with one another. To examine the extent of autocorrelation, we consider the ACF plot and then use a Partial ACF plot to better understand the source of the correlations, as described below.\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\npar(xpd=NA,oma=c(0,0,2,0))\nacf(Hasbro, main=\"ACF\", xlab=\"Lag\", ylab=\"\")\npacf(Hasbro, main=\"Partial ACF\", xlab=\"Lag\", ylab=\"\")\n```\n\nThe ACF plot makes it clear there is a great deal of autocorrelation, confirming that the stock value is correlated with itself over time. The positive values show the lags, or future stock prices, are positively correlated with one another - as one increases or decreases, so do the subsequent day's value, more often than not. This relationship between data points tapers off, however, where a stock price from several days ago has less influence on a future day's closing price. Even so, the fact that the ACF values are all far above the blue dotted lines, which represent a 95% confidence interval, tells us these results are statistically significant and we can be fairly certain this isn't just by chance.\n\nThe partial autocorrelation (PACF) plot also describes the autocorrelation, but in a slightly different way. The PACF measures the correlation between the residuals - or randomness in the data - with the next lag in the data. We see that the residuals of the lags after the first one are not statistically significant. This plot suggests that the correlation between one stock price and a future stock price isn't due to the residuals, but rather comes from another component. In this case, the source is likely the overall trend of the stock prices, as suggested above.\n\n###  Stationarity\n\nThese first three tasks have helped us better understand the data. They have also given us clues as to whether the data is stationary, a prerequisite for more in-depth statistical analysis. For a time series to be stationary, it needs to have a consistent mean and variance, meaning it centers around a consistent value and the changes over time aren't more extreme during one period than another.\n\nFrom our observations so far, we've noted a clear trend over time, a lack of seasonality, and a strong positive correlation between daily stock prices. This interpretation suggests the Hasbro stock price data is not stationary, as it's average value changes based on company performance and the variance in some years is much higher than others. This intuition is confirmed by a statistical check, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.\n\n#### Results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\n|                        |            |\n|------------------------|------------|\n| Dickey-Fuller          | -2.25      |\n| Lag order              | 10         |\n| **p-value**            | **0.4719** |\n| Alternative hypothesis | Stationary |\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n# tseries::adf.test(Hasbro)\n```\n\nWith a p-value of 0.4, our results are not statistically significant. We lack sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the data is non-stationary.\n\nOur next task, then, is to transform the data into a stationary format.\\\n\n### Differencing\n\nBecause the above dataset in its current form is not stationary, we use additional data transformations to make it more suitable for modeling. We difference our data, which transforms the time series into the change between each consecutive data point. Mathematically, this process is similar to a derivative, which calculates the rate of change of an equation. The first-order differencing helps reduce a trend if the underlying trend is linear, which is the case for our financial time series.\n\n```{r}\n\noriginal_plot <- autoplot(Hasbro)+ labs(y=\"Daily Price Change\", title=\"Hasbro Stock Price, 2019-2022\") + theme_minimal()\ndiff_plot <- autoplot(diff(Hasbro)) + labs(y=\"Daily Price Change\", title=\"First-Order Difference\") + theme_minimal()\n\n\ngrid.arrange(original_plot, diff_plot, nrow=2)\n\n```\n\nIn this case, the plot of the first-order difference shows us the daily change in the adjusted closing price of Hasbro stock from one day to another. We can verify the underlying math with a quick look at the most dramatic changes in price and compare it to the plot of the raw data above. We see the spikes and dips in the first order difference line up perfectly with dramatic shifts in the stock price, whether it was the phenomena of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 or growth and subsequent correction in 2019.\n\nWe then reconsider the ACF plot, this time comparing the autocorrelation of the original data with the new first-order difference series.\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\npar(xpd=NA,oma=c(0,0,2,0))\nacf(Hasbro, main=\"ACF, Original Data\")\nacf(diff(Hasbro), main=\"ACF, First-Order Difference\")\n```\n\nThe final results highlight the power of the differencing transformation. Whereas the autocorrelation of the original data is consistently present and highly varied, the ACF plot of our first-order difference data is much more in line with the requirements for a stationary series. While a small handful of the points go above our confidence interval threshold, it is clear this is a step in the right direction.\n\n###  Conclusion\n\nWe first explored our data by looking at how Hasbro's stock value has changed over the last several years. We then used lag, decomposition, and autocorrelation techniques to better understand the underlying data. When we determined the data was not stationary, we used differencing to center the data around a consistent mean and mitigate the variance. The result is a stationary series that represents the daily change in Hasbro's stock price and is ready to be used in statistical analysis.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"exploratory-data-analysis.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"visual","theme":"lumen","title":"Exploratory Data Analysis"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
