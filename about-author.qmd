Hi, I'm Phil.

I recently started working as a Data Scientist at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center. My current projects include transforming state reports on drinking water into an easily accessible database, improving our understanding of where communities get their water, and other means of making access to clean drinking water more equitable.

As a Data Science in Public Policy graduate student, I am both deepening my technical data science skills and applying these techniques to solve challenging and meaningful problems. In my Research Assistant role at Georgetown, I worked to identify racial disparity in drug arrests and improve arrest and prosecution practices through data analysis and machine learning. Other projects leveraged geospatial data to highlight communities inadequately served by water utility providers to help direct funding where it is most needed.

As a Data Analyst for Old Whaling Company, I optimize internal processes through automation and provide resources for data-driven decisions. Previously, I was a Data Modeler at the College of Charleston's Office of Enrollment Information, where I used predictive modeling to help identify students at risk of losing their scholarship eligibility.

When I'm not on the job, you'll find me planning my Dungeons & Dragons campaign, celebrating (and commiserating over) the New Orleans Saints, playing Destiny 2, or exploring the neighborhood with my wife and our senior rescue pups.
