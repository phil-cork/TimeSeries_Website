Fans of Magic the Gathering, however, had expressed these same frustrations for months before journalists and news pundits caught on. Is it possible that by analyzing the secondary market for Magic products, investors could have predicted this downturn sooner?\n\n\\\n\n![](images/Hasbro-logo-featured.jpg){fig-alt=\"Hasbro logo and iconic brands\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"355\"}\n\n\\\n\n\nHasbro is a United States-based, multinational conglomerate that owns the trademarks for a number of prominent toy and entertainment subsidiaries such as Milton Bradley, Tonka, Playskool, Parker Brothers and others. Their range of toy, game, and entertainment products include Nerf, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Monopoly, My Little Pony, and dozens of other brands. Chief among Hasbro's subsidiaries is Wizards of the Coast, the company responsible for the Dungeons & Dragons and Magic the Gathering brands. This project analyzes the Magic the Gathering trading card game as a proxy to better understand and potentially forecast Hasbro's financial performance.\n\n\\\n\n![](images/Magic-the-Gathering-logo.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\\\n\n### Magic the Gathering\n\nMagic the Gathering is a trading card game in which two or more players utilize their custom-tailored deck of cards that represent spells and creatures to battle one another. The game was first released by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and was the first trading card game of its kind, soon to be followed by similar games like Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh. As of April 2022, the game had approximately [35 million players](https://www.businessinsider.com/magic-the-gathering-announces-10-million-esports-program-for-2019-2018-12). Between 2008 and 2016, when the game saw an explosive growth in popularity, more than [twenty billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) Magic cards were manufactured. As of January 2023, there are more than [25,650 unique Magic cards](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?page=256&output=compact&action=advanced&type=%7C%5B%22Artifact%22%5D%7C%5B%22Conspiracy%22%5D%7C%5B%22Creature%22%5D%7C%5B%22Enchantment%22%5D%7C%5B%22Instant%22%5D%7C%5B%22Land%22%5D%7C%5B%22Phenomenon%22%5D%7C%5B%22Plane%22%5D%7C%5B%22Planeswalker%22%5D%7C%5B%22Scheme%22%5D%7C%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D%7C%5B%22Vanguard%22%5D).\n\nMagic the Gathering is a valuable tool for thinking about Hasbro's value in three ways. First, Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) has become an increasingly important subsidiary to its parent company. While other subsidiaries are losing money, Hasbro's reported record growth from Wizards of the Coast. Second, because Magic the Gathering is a competitive trading card game, there is an open market where cards purchased from WOTC are sold by consumers. This secondary market helps explain Magic's performance in more precise financial outcomes. Finally, Hasbro has been in the financial news lately due to some questionable Magic the Gathering product decisions made in the last year, so it is a both timely and relevant consideration.\n\n\\\n\n### Project Overview\n\nMore specifically, this project leverages product pricing data on the secondary market to better understand and potentially forecast the performance of the brand and its parent company, Hasbro.\n\nSince this endeavor is fairly open-ended, ten questions will guide the analysis:\n\n1.

Is there a seasonal component to Hasbro's stock based on the release of Magic the Gathering products?\n\n8.  Is there a seasonal component to Magic the Gathering's products secondary market behavior?\n\n9.  Is there a correlation between Magic the Gathering product performance and Hasbro stock price changes?\n\n10.
