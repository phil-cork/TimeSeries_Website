107hisv,People hardly talk about it but there are numerous constructed viable Magic cards that are significantly cheaper than they were just a few years ago because of recent reprints.,True,"People don't acknowledge it enough but there are numerous constructed viable Magic cards that are significantly cheaper than they were just a few years ago because of recent reprints.

It's easy to name cards that are expensive now, overdue for a reprint and cost more than they might have cost a couple years ago, but we should also focus on the overall trends and the examples on the other end of the spectrum. I think this is something many players, especially newer players are sometimes unaware of or take for granted.

\[\[Baleful Strix\]\] was a $22 card and now it's a sub $2 card.

\[\[Fellwar Stone\]\] was a $6 card just a couple years ago and now it's a sub $1 card.

\[\[Wayfarer's Bauble\]\] was a $4 common just a couple years ago and now it's a sub $1 card.

\[\[Scalding Tarn\]\] was a $100+ card in 2019. Today, because of Modern Horizons 2, it's a sub $20 card.

\[\[Oracle of Mul Daya\]\] was a $40 card a couple years ago. Now it is a $7 card.

\[\[Mana Drain\]\] was a $150 card a few years ago. Today, it is a sub $40 card.

\[\[Arcane Signet\]\] was a $10 card and it's a sub $1 card now.

\[\[Three Visits\]\] was a $50+ card that is now a $5 card.

\[\[Nature's Lore\]\] was a $6 card and is now a sub $2 card.

\[\[Liliana of the Veil\]\] was a $90 just a couple years ago and it is now a $20 card because of DMU.

Here are some more examples of cards that are significantly more affordable because of recent reprints:

\[\[Thumming Stone\]\], \[\[Enchantress's Presence\]\], \[\[Staff of Domination\]\], \[\[Shardless Agent\]\], \[\[Death's Shadow\]\], \[\[Mishra's Bauble\]\], \[\[Path to Exile\]\], \[\[Blasphemous Act\]\], \[\[Celestial Colonnade\]\], \[\[Vandalblast\]\], \[\[Talisman of Progress\]\], \[\[Bountiful Promenade\]\], \[\[Thought Vessel\]\], \[\[Curse of Opulence\]\], \[\[Fyndhorn Elves\]\], \[\[Selfless Spirit\]\], \[\[Wrenn and Six\]\], \[\[Leyline of Anticipation\]\], \[\[Snow-Covered Mountain\]\], along with many other examples.

Today, there are over 20,000 unique Magic cards. Only about 200 or so non-reserved list cards cost more than $20 on the secondary market (less than 1%).

Nearly half of those cards are from Portal Three Kingdoms. These cards are essentially collector's items that are very rare but players aren't clamoring to play.

Some of those 200 cards are newer cards that are less than two years old so it is reasonable that a reprint hasn't happened yet.

People often say the number of products where reprints are is low, but I disagree. There are $10+ cards that are reprinted regularly in many sets and products, ""The List"", Masters sets, pre-constructed decks, Secret Lairs, Standard sets on bonus sheets, Commander Legends sets, etc.

In the past 2-3 years, Magic has reprinted more cards than ever. People frequently complain about how Wizards creates too many products and product fatigue but it's important to keep in mind that most of the cards that Magic prints are reprints. These reprints are the reason the cards I mentioned earlier are much more accessible than they were a few years prior.

Every card can't be affordable but the overwhelming majority aren't excessively expensive and that's a great thing.

So many people are so negative and only willing to focus on what they can't have and what they can't afford when there are so many cards that are affordable including viable, interesting, dynamic and powerful cards including cards that not too long ago were very inaccessible for many players.

There are also newer cards that are very affordable and flying under the radar now and will become more expensive in a couple years when people start to catch on more. I'm already seeing it now, newer pet cards of mine like \[\[Witch's Clinic\]\] and \[\[Irenicus's Vile Duplication\]\] are no longer bulk rares as more players are realizing their potential. But there are so many interesting cards that are affordable from recent sets like Commander Legends 2, Kaldheim and Dominaria United.

When we only fixate on which cards have gotten more expensive, we are ignoring or downplaying the fact that in recent years numerous cards have significantly dropped in secondary market value because of reprints (including some of the notable examples I mentioned earlier).

I've been building budget decks that are sub $100 and sub $50 for Commander with one of my primary play groups recently. Doing so has helped me understand there are many cards that I wouldn't have been able fit in a $100 deck just a few years ago.

107j0l2,"MaRo's ""Drive to Work"" podcast gets its 1000th episode this week - Here's 50-and-a-bit random facts I learned from listening to it",True,"**General design principles**

1. Richard Garfield says he’s glad he didn’t originally keyword Vigilance: the name is such a neat flavorful fit for the ability that he’s not sure he would have come up with it himself. \[#737\]


2. Summoning sickness was not originally conceived for balance reasons. Richard Garfield’s original motivation was to add more strategy to the choice of whether to play a creature before combat or after combat. \[#269\]


3. The letter K is often used in printing to represent black ink. MaRo says that, had the R&D team known this at the time, WUBRG would likely have been WBKRG. \[#959\]


4. MaRo wonders if in hindsight it would have been worth having evergreen spell subtypes (e.g. elemental subtypes like Fire), so that cards could sometimes care about them in a flavorful way. \[#958\]


5. The worst mechanics are often those which have a very clear flavor to them (MaRo cites Haunt as an example of this). \[#639\]


6. At some stage there will likely be a mechanism to interact with emblems. \[#697\]


7. “Can’t block” effects used to be in black, mechanically representing black’s selfishness, whereas red used “must attack if able”. It turned out that “must attack if able” doesn’t play very well, so red increasingly leans into “can’t block” effects (which in practice are similar). \[#456\]


8. Impulsive draw was specifically designed with Commander in mind, since it provides card advantage in the late game (covering red’s weakness) without affecting the early game very much. \[#456\]


9. Artifacts have their own “color pie”, in the sense that there are certain effects (e.g. repeatable milling) which tend to appear strictly on colorless artifact cards. \[#256\]


10. MaRo suspects that *Pokémon* used double-digit power and toughness to one-up *Magic*, which was followed by *Yu-Gi-Oh* using triple-digit power and toughness. *Duel Masters* was then designed with cards with quadruple-digit power. \[#417\]


11. R&D is very cautious about instant-speed activated abilities at common because of how much they add to board complexity. Tapping is an exception, because tapping a creature tends to take away decision-making complexity rather than adding to it. \[#144\]


12. A classic example of a design idea which makes sense intuitively but is hard to template is when a card ends up having to say “when this enters the battlefield, if it’s on the battlefield, ...” \[#144\]


13. “Creativity is what happens when curiosity meets passion” \[#726\]


**Specific cards/sets - pre-Magic Origins**

14. Floral Spuzzem (from *Legends*) had the unusual card text ""If Floral Spuzzem attacks an opponent and is not blocked, then Floral Spuzzem may choose to destroy a target artifact under that opponent's control and deal no damage."" When playing with this card, MaRo always pretends to ask the card whether it wants to deal damage or destroy an artifact. \[#996\]

15. Enters-the-battlefield effects were designed simultaneously for *Visions* and *Tempest*. At the time, neither team knew that the other team was also making ETB effects.  \[#877\]

16. Permanents with fading enter with fade counters, lose a counter at each upkeep, and are sacrificed when it’s no longer possible to remove a counter. This was originally meant to parallel the way decking works (you lose the game when you can’t draw a card any more, not when you draw your last card), but players found it unintuitive so the behaviour was changed for Vanishing (where the permanent is sacrificed when the last counter is removed). \[?\]

17. *Kamigawa’s* designers had a rule that the set couldn’t use any multicolor elements. This turned out to be a big hindrance in a top-down set, since many top-down ideas are hard to execute in monocolor. \[#819\]

18. The hybrid frame was originally designed and tested for normal multicolor cards. It was easy to deploy for hybrid cards in *Ravnica* because it had already been prepared. \[#357\]

19. Sometimes mechanics which fit very well into a two-color combination don’t fit very well with the philosophy of a guild. For example, Bloodrush turned out to be a poor fit for Gruul. The strategic tension between playing a creature or keeping it in hand for its Bloodrush ability is interesting, but many Gruul players are more interested in playing all their creatures and attacking with them. \[#285\]

20. Izzet is always a hard guild to design for. Izzet colors are a natural fit for “artifacts-matters” effects, but the heavy multicolor theme of Ravnica sets mean that there is little room for artifacts in Limited. \[#285\]

21. Tarmogoyf was removed from the *Future Sight* file to make way for a planeswalker card, but then reinstated when it was decided to save planeswalkers for *Lorwyn*. In the process of being removed and re-added, Tarmogoyf gained a point of toughness and had its casting cost lowered, which contributed to its high power level. \[#3\]

22. *Lorwyn* originally had -1/-1 counters, the idea being that weakening something was somehow “friendlier” than damaging or destroying it. It turned out after playtesting that -1/-1 counters were more “cruel” than damage, so they were moved to Shadowmoor. \[#603\]

23. The design team likes to design mechanics with as many variables (called “knobs”) as possible, so that they can be easily balanced. Wither originally started as Wither N, assigning a number of -1/-1 counters independent of the damage-dealer’s toughness, but this was changed to keep it simpler.

24. As well as Lightning Bolt, R&D considered reprinting Counterspell and Swords to Plowshares in *Magic 2010*. \[#879\]

25. A big goal of *Zendikar’s* Landfall mechanic was to reward players for doing something they’re already doing, rather than creating “negative tension” (i.e. rewarding players for doing something they don’t normally want to do). MaRo thinks that this is a big factor in Landfall’s popularity. \[#877\]

26. Ulamog’s Crusher in *Rise of the Eldrazi* was specifically designed with a “must attack” ability because players were reluctant to attack using Annihilator cards. \[#780\]

27. There are generally two ways to design cards around graveyard: either use the graveyard as a “barometer”, checking to see if a condition is met (e.g. Delirium, Threshold), or use the graveyard as a “resource”, spending cards from it (e.g. Embalm, Escape). \[?\]

28. R&D considered returning to Ulgrotha (*Homelands*) as a top-down Gothic horror world, but ultimately opted to build a new world from scratch. The presence of minotaurs on Ulgrotha (which seemed a bit weird) was one of the deciding factors. \[#25\]

29. Werewolves were the most important part of *Innistrad* to get right, because *Magic* had so rarely done them before. \[#469\]

30. Innistrad did not originally have a tribal theme. When exploring top-down designs for artifacts, many of them wanted to care about specific creature types, and this eventually grew into a fully-fledged tribal theme for the set. \[?\]

31. *Fate Reforged* began with the idea of a small set which could be drafted with the large set before it and the large set after it. What would this mean from a story perspective? One idea was an “ark” carrying people between two worlds (each world represented by a large set). Another idea was a battleground between two opposing sides who inhabit different planes or dimensions. In the end, *Fate Reforged* was set in the past, with *Khans of Tarkir* and *Dragons of Tarkir* being set in two different versions of the future. \[#254\]

32. When designing cards with an off-color activated ability, MaRo thinks it’s important that the activated ability let the card do something that wouldn’t normally be in its slice of the color pie. Hence MaRo was unhappy with Bloodfire Mentor: this is a red card with a blue activated ability letting it draw and discard a card, but red can already discard and then draw. \[#258\]

33. Demons not originally in the design of *Khans of Tarkir*, the rationale being that big fliers would feel too much like Dragons (which weren’t supposed to be on Tarkir). If demons had been planned in the start, this would have been a great set to sneak in Tombstalker from *Future Sight*. \[#258\]


**Specific cards/sets - post-Magic Origins**

34. *Amonkhet’s* design suffered from being so close to *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Ixalan*. MaRo feels that Aftermath and Embalm may have been better executed with double-faced cards, but the use of DFCs in *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Ixalan* meant they couldn’t be used for *Amonkhet*. \[#536\]

35. *Amonkhet’s* proximity to *Shadows over Innistrad* also made play balance harder. In particular, it was harder to put graveyard hosers in *Kaladesh* (which normally play design would want to do, to encourage playing *Kaladesh* cards) without pre-emptively hosing *Amonkhet*. \[#536\]

36. Pirates were much easier to design than dinosaurs because of the many pirate tropes which already exist. Moreover, pirates can be motivated by different things, which makes it easier to assign them different colours. With dinosaurs it’s much harder: the only thing they’re motivated by is wanting to eat you. \[#583\]

37. The Enrage mechanic was difficult to design for: by its nature, Enrage works best on smaller creatures, but dinosaurs are usually large creatures.  \[#583\]

38. Some players saw the three-colour factions in *Ixalan* as encouragement to draft three colours, but in fact the Limited environment wasn’t designed with this in mind. \[#583\]

39. The allied factions in *Unstable* evolved directly from needing to make Steamflogger Boss (from *Future Sight*) fit: Steamflogger Boss meant the set needed Goblins, which in turn means it needed allied factions (Goblins don’t work very well in enemy factions). \[#822\]

40. Richard Garfield personally objected to giving *Dominaria* a graveyard theme, reasoning that a creature that died one or two turns ago shouldn’t really be considered “history”. It was also hard to make yet another graveyard set so soon after *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Amonkhet*. \[#851\]

41. Dominaria almost had a common Saga cycle depicting five different interpretations of Urza. \[#851\]

42. It took a very long time for R&D to realise that *War of the Spark* needed loads of planeswalkers. For much of the design, this seemed clearly impossible to do, so they looked for other ways to represent a war with many planeswalkers (e.g. cards representing multiple planeswalkers teaming up). \[#638\]

43. The hardest aspect of designing *War of the Spark* was making all 32 planeswalkers feel distinct. For example, Chandra had to avoid direct damage effects so that she wouldn’t overlap too much with Jaya.\[#651\]

44. When designing new planeswalkers for *War of the Spark*, R&D very consciously came up with characters with a very clean mechanical execution (e.g. Teyo, who makes shields). Planeswalkers like Dovin Baan had proven problematic: although they are popular characters, the kind of magic they specialise in is very difficult to translate onto cards. \[#651\]

45. Klothys (in *Theros Beyond Death*) was originally based on Aphrodite, before the needs of the story shaped her into the goddess of destiny. \[#908\]

46. *Zendikar Rising’s* mythic rare modal double-faced cards were specifically designed to have effects which were splashy but don’t have a long-term impact on the board, e.g. “you have no maximum hand size for the rest of the game”, “indestructible until end of turn”.  \[#923\]

47. Skyclave Apparition was added to *Zendikar Rising* very late. Because it came so late it was subject to many design constraints, including having to use the blue X/X tokens from Inscription of Insight. Despite this, it ended up being a well-received card with an impact on Standard – making it one of the set’s biggest Play Design successes. \[#923\]

48. *Kaldheim* had a realm of shapeshifters long before it was known that Changelings would have a mechanical presence in the set. \[#824\]

49. As a way of consciously differentiating *Strixhaven* from other magical schools (e.g. Harry Potter), the colleges were designed focus on ordinary subjects (e.g. literature, history) but have a magical “spin”. \[#822\]

50. Modal double-faced cards were originally designed purely for *Strixhaven*. When adventures were added late in *Throne of Eldraine’s* design, it was felt that they took away some of the impact of MDFCs which combined creatures with spells. So MDFCs were added to *Zendikar Rising* and *Kaldheim* in ways that showed off more of the design space potential (e.g. creatures/lands or creatures/artifacts).  \[#952\]

51. Originally, the Wanderer was going to get compleated in *Neon Dynasty*, but they switched to Tamiyo because her compleation would have a much greater emotional impact.  \[#927\]

52. *Brothers’ War* deliberately made all its artifacts colorless, in order to capture the “retro” feel. The sole exception was The Temporal Anchor, which is colored in order to capture being from the “present”.  \[#993\]",1131,0.95,299,magicTCG,2023-01-09,0,reddit

107nm3d,"Anyone Else having trouble getting excited for magic ""changing forever"" in 2023?",True,"They keep teasing how MoM Aftermath is going to be huge changes for the game both mechanically and in the lore, and with the path MTG has been headed down lately, I find it really difficult to be anything other than anxious that things will get worse. Like I can't think of anything they'd announce that would get me excited, I'm just hoping the announcement isn't actually a big deal, and that the game won't change too much. What do people think it's going to be?

Personally, my worry is that it's going to be that they're retiring one or more formats, or that universes Beyond is going to play a bigger role in the game going forward. Either of those might call into question my devotion to a game I've loved for over ten years.

The only news that would really cause me to breathe a sigh of relief would be if this reckoning took place entirely within the lore/flavor of the game, rather than the mechanics or formats. This would be fine with me, as I like plenty of the newer characters and story directions.

I'm rambling, but I'm just worried that they'll move the game to completely focus on commander, or get rid of standard rotation and flood the formats I like to play (pioneer and modern) with horizons-style power level mistakes without the security valve of standard to affect card design. Or they'll stop designing for draft. I don't know. I just can't think of anything actually good it could be.

100v4hk,I hope after March of the Machines the main cast of planeswalkers will take a back seat in future sets,True,"We have planeswalkers like Ramaz that never got a card, who was set up to be Chandra's antagonist. He was the reason she stole the dragon scroll way back in OG Zendikar, which lead up to the Rise of the Eldrazi plotline. Chandra chases him back to his homeplane of Kaldheim and then.... nothing? A decade later he still doesn't have a card or a resolved plot.  
 He was tied into Bolas, so his plot can't really be resolved anymore since the finished off Bolas in War of the Spark... but we visited Kaldheim, so he could've at least had card since it's his homeplane, but half the planeswalker slots were taken up by planeswalkers that already had a card. I mean Kaya got two cards in 2021, she was in Innistrad and Kaldheim.  
I felt the same way about Capenna, all three walkers were existing/mainstay planeswalkers. There was no new planeswalkers from that set.

101g8nn,"Magic used to have an artificial funnel bringing people together, now they don't, and you can see the entire community fracture in real time.",True,"As a store owner, I have had a really hard time resurrecting Magic events in my store, with the sole exception of free Friday night Commander get-togethers (which are awesome, I'm certainly not complaining about that!), and I'm looking for advice on what to do, specifically about Standard.

About me: I've been doing this for ten years, the first four and a half for someone else and going on six years for me and my partners. I've played Magic since 1994. We work hard to be the Cheers of game stores and, so far, I think we've really succeeded. We're well-reviewed and one of the few Premium stores in my state despite being a small market with 40,000 people. The community is *really* good to us.

What we've been doing: We've ran free Standard every Monday since we opened almost six years ago. Before the pandemic, 20+ in the tournament and 40-50+ in the store at large. I can sometimes drag 8 for Standard but nowadays you can usually count that number on one hand. I'm familiar with seasonal attendance fluctuations but it just doesn't get off the ground anymore in general. Free promo packs to Top 8 (and free real packs if I have over 8 honestly). We have meta decks built that people can just borrow for free. We advertise, we push it in store, and we still struggle.

A lot of store owners blame Arena for the decline because of its convenience and keeping people at home rather than in their stores and, maybe there's some truth to that, but I really believe that shouldn't matter much if I can offer the in-store experience that Arena (and Amazon and TCG Player etc.) can't. It's possible I'm naive. I love Arena and am of the opinion that it's great because it keeps people engaged until they can go out and have a real, quality LGS experience. And that's on me to provide. Which I really truly and honestly think we do 99% of the time. (Sorry guy who called ahead for us to hold a draft for five minutes because he was running late then left a one star review when he was instead twenty minutes late with fresh ChikFilA and we started without him.)

A lot of people blame the annihilation of tournament Magic for the lack of attendance at LGS events but, honestly, the grinder population is so low that it's a blip in the metrics for us. That might be different in bigger population centers but our events, even the competitive ones, are generally filled with feelgood people who just wanna flop cards (most of whom are coincidentally great at Magic). We've done big events (64-person drafts, big prize tournaments, etc.) so we know how to run and promote them but the RCQs lost their luster after the first round and people are back to general apathy for Pro level Magic, especially Standard.

And then there's a variety of smaller problems that have nothing to do with Magic (culture shifts, Covid, the massive amount of other easily digestible hobbies and entertainment) but Magic is such a good game that I think it can weather all of those challenges.

The thing I don't think it can weather, however, is the unrelenting tide of products for everyone. We like to laugh about ""this product is not for you"" but, if we're honest, there really is a product for everyone. You can individualize everything about how you play right down to the extreme nuts and bolts and, to be fair, I think that's rad as hell. Everyone should be able to enjoy this game.

The big unintended consequence of that, though, is that there's no longer an artificial funnel pushing players together.

In the old days, if you wanted Magic cards, you pretty much had to buy Standard sets. Sure, we had some supplemental stuff, but the bulk of purchases were always on Standard products by virtue of there really wasn't anything else. And, if you have Standard cards, you're generally gonna want to play with them.

There's no funnel anymore.

By individualized Magic purchases down to very specific Secret Lairs and not at least tempting players to play Standard, we have lost this great connective tissue that we didn't even know we had until it was gone. There's nothing pushing us (I'm one of you despite being an NPC behind a counter) together anymore except the format that is literally ""the one you play with everyone"" because that's how it's advertised. An EDH player doesn't even have to look at a Standard pack anymore if they don't want to and I really think someone in a meeting room somewhere should have thought about that. Sometimes we need that stuff to hold communities together.

All that to ask you, the most entrenched among us, what the heck I'm supposed to do? Do I just cancel Standard? Sometimes it's better not to offer events if they won't make. Is there some incentive I'm not thinking about that won't bankrupt us? Is there some marketing strategy that has worked for other stores? We aren't a big town and I feel like it would be such a huge shame to not have a Standard anymore. I love Type II.

Thanks for listening to an old man yelling at clouds, and thanks in advance for any advice you might have!",720,0.95,296,magicTCG,2023-01-02,0,reddit

108ptqx,"There's precisely zero chance that the big change with MOM is ""Universes Beyond is now canon,"" so can people please stop tossing that out wildly and turning meaningful MOM speculation posts into yet another pro/anti UB circlejerk? Here are some actual, plausible possibilities!",True,"Anyone who's done anything with IP use negotiations will tell you that tying your canon lore to characters and worlds whose IP you *do not own* and can use only on a *very limited basis* is absolute madness, the sort of thing that any business on Hasbro's scale has an entire legal department to say ""this is unworkable to the point of being impossible"" even if the story team were convinced it were the way to go.  


Here are actual possibilities they might be planning, culled after my eyes glazed over from scrolling through the many, many comments by people just looking for one more opportunity to complain about UB or whatever else they currently dislike about MTG's direction:

&#x200B;

* Planes may be introduced as a new permanent type, thematically tied to the new ease of interplanar travel.
   * The counter-argument: how do you design a new permanent type that a) has a lot of design space, b) offers new and interesting decisions for both deckbuilding and gameplay, c) doesn't eat into existing design space for artifacts/permanents/planeswalkers? Seems hard, and most of what people have imagined in the comments section feels like a riff on World Enchantments, or the Planechase Planes but without any dice-based randomness.
* Some sort of 'second deck' mechanic, a-la Contraptions and Attractions.
   * The counter-argument: It's certainly possible, but those tend to be parasitic mechanics (that is, mechanics that require heavy in-set support to synergize) that work best when confined to a single set. And we already kiiiiinda have this with the current use of the sideboard as a learnboard/wishboard and other similar mechanics; a permanent 'second deck' mechanic might be cannibalizing that design space. The design team likes to give themselves the freedom to dip into and out of these 'outside of the usual table space' mechanics in Premiere Sets (Dungeons, for example, or Companions or Learnboards) without retaining them as permanent features of the game. And this is all talking Constructed; Limited environments would be even trickier to integrate a second deck with.
* Planeswalkers from here on out being designed more powerfully but also harder to cast, a-la the Meld Walkers from BRO
   * The counter-argument: BRO's meld walkers were a very specific answer to the design problem of conveying the sheer power of ""oldwalkers"" like Urza in the modern state of the game and within the Planeswalker card type. And if anything they've been moving in the opposite direction, exploring the freedom that sets like WAR and ONE offer to design more planeswalker-rich environments with a wider range of power level.
* A grab-bag of smaller changes designed to collectively inaugurate a new 'era' of the game -- maybe a new evergreen keyword or two, upkeep moving after draw, changes to the Legend Rule, a new frame perhaps, shifts to the color pie, you name it.
   * The counter-argument: This would feel pretty anti-climactic, wouldn't it? I could imagine some of these accompanying a major shift, but having this be the whole change would be giving us a lot of fine print without any headlines, so to speak. And any changes that centered on EDH would touch on the RC, which has historically been pretty resistant to big change and adamant about why things should remain the way they are within their domain.

I'm sure there are more I'm missing! Maybe we can discuss the actual possibilities in this thread, rather than wading through a sea of comments that all just amount to ""I'm pissed at Wizards right now, so let me wildly speculate on all the things they might do in the future that I'd hate if they did."" If there are big possibilities I'm missing that people raise in the comments, I'll edit this post to add them up here! My personal bet at the moment is on Planes becoming a new permanent type, since MaRo has repeatedly discussed a new permanent type as a possibility.",632,0.83,387,magicTCG,2023-01-11,0,reddit

10hp49o,Might this storyline end with Phyrexia being made to swap places with Zhalfir?,True,"Teferi got cut adrift in time and ended up on Zhalfir, so it's clear they're intending to bring it back pretty soon. I'm wondering if that's how Phyrexia will be defeated: getting cast into the void by Zhalfir replacing it. This would be satisfying for a few reasons:

\- Zhalfir was originally phased out to protect it from Phyrexia, so it phasing back in to protect the rest of the multiverse would be a neat bookend

\- Elesh Norn wants to make the multiverse one under Phyrexia, so putting her somewhere where Phyrexia is the only thing to exist is like, irony or something. Our buddy(?) Urabrask, on the other hand, would be much more content with the situation.

\- From WotC's perspective it's always better to put villains on ice rather than destroy them entirely. I would personally hope, if/when Phyrexia returns, it would be a new iteration - not that I don't like this one. But it's reasonable to keep their options open.

Maybe there are story reasons why what I'm suggesting would be impossible, but it does feel like a fun way to tie everything together. What do you think?",619,0.97,137,magicTCG,2023-01-21,0,reddit

zzpxu7,"Mark Rosewater on the reasoning behind the high volume of Magic products released in recent years, the product fatigue some enfranchised players are feeling and how Magic currently going through another flux point.",True,"[Yesterday on Blogatog](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/705025422806614016/hi-mark-i-have-a-personal-experience-that-id#notes), Mark Rosewater responded in depth to a player sharing their perspective and experience with product fatigue that I believe the r/magicTCG community would think of as interesting. 

In the response, Mark emphasizes that players enjoy and dislike different things and it would be very difficult to come to a consensus on which products to not release (for example, from 2022, some players would have been content if New Capenna, Unfinity and Double Masters 2022 weren't released this year while other players loved those products and would have been very disappointed if they weren't released).

He also stresses that attracting new players is very important as new life blood is fundamental to any game, especially an older game like Magic.

His answer is detailed and contains nuance so for full context, see the entire exchange below:

**winterwarp** **asked:**

>Hi, Mark.   
>  
>I have a personal experience that I'd like to share that affects my perspective on the conversations around product fatigue.   
>  
>When the original Game Night product came out, I didn't even know that it existed. I didn't learn about its existence until something like two years later, and my thought was ""I would've like to have known about that at the time.""   
>  
>My reaction to having completely and utterly been unaware of a product like that was to try to increase the amount of effort I put into learning about new products that were coming out in order to prevent another product that I would like to engage with from going under my radar. The problem is that even just paying attention to what's coming out can become exhausting and overwhelming with the amount of products which have been getting released.   
>  
>So, I guess my point is that when I hear you and other spokespeople responding to complaints of product fatigue by saying ""only engage with the products that most excite you"" that doesn't seem to address the problem that the process of paying attention in order to know which products most excite you can itself be overwhelming and exhausting. Paying attention can be exhausting. And not paying attention can lead to products you would've loved going under your radar.

**Mark Rosewater responded**: 

>Here’s the challenge. There’s a lot of different Magic players that want very different things. We want to produce what makes Magic special for each player in enough volume that they stay invested. That’s what’s going on, we’re trying to make sure our proverbial buffet always has the food that excites each individual diner.  
>  
>Putting out less food means that we’re depriving some diners of the food that makes them most excited to come to the buffet. We do that long enough, and they stop coming.  
>  
>A good example of this, is while people suggest we offer less products, which products go away is under great debate. Everybody wants the thing they love to stay, and the things they enjoy less to go away, but which is which varies person to person.  
>  
>Also, we’re always trying to attract new diners. Certain food might make some diners sample the buffet that haven’t tried it before. New life blood is fundamental to any game, but especially one with Magic’s longevity.  
>  
>Any food option we remove impacts someone and makes them enjoy the buffet less. I get that it makes the buffet harder to process at large, but fundamentally, a buffet is about picking and choosing the food that makes the best meal for you, not groking the menu as a whole.  
>  
>What I think is going on is Magic is at another flux point (and it’s had many over the years). It’s adapting to player desires, and changing in new ways. When that happens, both the audience and R&D has to adapt as well. Maybe we have to change how we communicate new products. Maybe there needs to be a lighter track for those that want a sense of what’s coming without the depth that we normally provide. I agree that old systems might not make sense in the new world, but I don’t think it’s a reason to reject the new world. It’s a reason to figure out how to adapt.",552,0.88,838,magicTCG,2022-12-31,0,reddit

109dp7a,Mark Rosewater shares some of the key mechanics and big changes to Magic over the years that he had a major hand in designing,True,"[Today on Blogatog](https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/706177298064392192/hi-mark-ive-been-seeing-some-pockets-of-the#notes), a reader mentioned some of the negative comments and harsh criticism directed against Mark Rosewater coming from certain enfranchised players online. 

They asked Mark if he could name some examples of fundamental changes and to Magic the Gathering over the years that are widely viewed as positive that he had a major hand in creating to draw a contrast.

I believe people in the Magic community will find this interesting, informative and worthy of discussion.

**Note**: Listed below is the full exchange for those that can't access Tumblr:

**pancakemisery asked**:

*Hi Mark,*

*I've been seeing some pockets of the online community being rather focused on making snide remarks about you, in particular, about what people see as design mistakes. Honestly, I think a lot of it, even if the criticisms have valid points, are just needlessly mean spirited and not trying to come from a place of good faith criticism. I think part of that is people focusing on the more obvious mistakes but not knowing the things you've spearheaded that have been perceived widely as great changes for the game.*

*What would you say are some of the biggest changes for the game that have been as close to universally accepted as good that you played a significant part in having made happen? Because I think people would be surprised about what they love that you helped make happen.*

**Mark Rosewater responds**:

Some of the things which are popular that I had a major hand in:

* Bonus Sheets
* Changeling
* Colored Artifacts
* Constellation
* Creature Types as a Set Theme
* Curses
* Devotion
* Double-Faced Cards
* Enchantment Creatures
* Energy
* Equipment
* Faction Sets
* Flash
* Flashback
* Focus on Top-Down Design
* Hybrid Mana
* Imprint
* Keywording of Deathtouch, Lifelink, Reach, and “dies”
* Landfall
* Morph
* Much of R&D Lingo (”French Vanilla”, “Lenticular”, etc.)
* Planeswalkers (the card type)
* Player Psychographics (Timmy/Tammy, Johnny/Jenny, Spike)
* Poison Returning
* Populate
* Proliferate
* Prowess
* Race/Class
* Raid
* Reusing of Named Nonevergreen Keyword Mechanics
* Sagas
* Split Cards
* Squirrels
* Vehicles
* The Weatherlight Saga

106plhl,"So, with Glissa and Slobad and Karn being close in the story again...",True,"...what are yall thinking are the chances well see our favourite shiny ball, the Mirari, back in action? Perhaps even back in Memnarch form.

I think theyve kinda set it up with the story with Tezzert last year. Memnarch is a big mystery to old Tezzy, and the Phyrexians seem to refuse to talk about him at all, probably bc he got \*this\* close to stopping their entire plan all by himself. He was the one who managed to cure his body (if not his mind) of the oil after all, and if he had claimed Glissas spark, he wouldve burned the world clean of their influence. Seems kinda understandable that the Phyrexians are not all too happy to talk about him.

It has to happen to some extend, with Karn, Glissa and Slobad all taking part of the story, and the Mirari being MIA since forever. If it doesnt, it would be the iggest waste in perhaps the entire MTG story up to this point.

Perhaps Karn will tell Tezzy what the Phyrexians wont: the true nature of Memnarch and what he was trying to do, the fact that he still exists as the Mirari, and that the Phyrexians fear it. So his role in the story would be that theyll bring him back as a weapon against the Phyrexians.",439,0.94,88,magicTCG,2023-01-08,0,reddit

10dowv6,"Hear me out, here's my theory on the March of the Machine symbol. (spoilers)",True,"# At the end of the Phyrexia All Will Be One story (spoilers obv) things are really bleak.

So I thought to myself, how can the heroes recover and find a way to fight against the menace of Phyrexia?

It came down to one simple fact. The Realmbreaker. It ties everything going forward and is how they're doing all the things they're doing, right?

How does the Realmbreaker operate? It connects each realm through opening Omenpaths like on Kaldheim, which allows the connection between realms (which Phyrexia has repurposed to target \*planes\* instead) and then slams them together in what is known as a Doomskar.

In theory, this attack on the multiverse will allow not only Phyrexia to invade multiple planes at once, but also maintain the connection so long as the Realmbreaker operates.

However, there's one flaw to this plan that they did not account for in their urge to go ahead with invasion.

A potential solution, all the way back when Kaldheim was introduced has lain dormant in thoughts for a long time:

# THE SWORD OF THE REALMS.

It was shown to be utilized by Halvar to meditate on and completely open and close rifts depending on how well the user knows and uses weapons.

**It's no secret that Tyvar and Kaya are two of the last left uncompleated during the strike force into New Phyrexia.** They know about the Sword of the Realms and what it can do.

But clearly, the Sword itself isn't powerful enough to affect entire planes, right? Well, what if it was enhanced by a conveniently picked up Luxior that Kaito nabbed at the end of the Phyrexia story? A merging of two blades into one, wielded by an Elspeth who survived a sylex blast, also angry and ready to deal a decisive blow to the Phyrexians?

Time will tell, but I think my theory is on the money.

tl;dr: The MOM symbol is the Sword of the Realms from Kaldheim merged with Luxior. Possibly taken to Purphoros to get it reforged on Theros during the events of March of the Machine.",377,0.96,114,magicTCG,2023-01-16,0,reddit

She does it to prevent 'other planes'from being leveled and the flavour text is quite candid that if she hadn't, New Phyrexia would have been annihilated.

Here is were all the main players in the story currently stand! Let me know if I've left something out in the comments! Spoilers for everything up until the end of the ONE set stories, obviously.

&#x200B;

>Living (or living-ish) and non-Universes Beyond Planeswalkers only.

>Not in main story as of yet so basically complete question marks: **Aminatou**, **Estrid**, **Grist**, **Sivitri Scarzam**, **Comet**, and the one dude from all the curse cards.

**Ajani Goldmane** — *Compleated.* Most likely compleated by Sheoldred while on Dominaria or while visiting Tamiyo after she was compleated. Fought against Elspeth at Realmbreaker before being knocked out by her.

**Angrath** — *Unknown.* Assumed on his home plane being a good Mino-daddy to his Mino-kids.

**Arlinn Kord** — Shoring up defenses on Innistrad alongside Sorin.

**Ashiok** — *Unknown.* Last seen fiddling with Elesh Norn’s dream on New Phyrexia. Stated they have a ‘new purpose’ in regards to Elspeth in recent story.

**Basri Ket** —*Unknown.* Last heard traveling the multiverse after Sparking.

**Calix** — *Unknown.* Looking for Elspeth in all the wrong planes.

**Chandra Nalaar** — On Kaladesh saying goodbyes to her mother Pia before returning to Dominaria to be back-up. 

**Daretti** — *Unknown.* Last seen on Fiora working with Queen Marchesa.

**Davriel Cane** — *Unknown.* Last seen fleeing Ravnica after the War of the Spark.

**Elspeth Tirel** —*Unknown Fate.* After fighting off Ajani, she made it to Realmbreaker in time to stop Jace from destroying the tree with the Sylex. Stabbed Jace with her sword before taking the Sylex from him, allowing herself and the Sylex to either disintegrate or planeswalk away with it. Art for the moment seems to see her breaking apart, but the story describes her 'disappearing'. Going to have to wait for official word on what became of her.

**Garruk Wildspeaker** — *Unknown.* Last seen dropping the Kennith twin kids off at Kylem before leaving to get milk. Should be back any time now. 

**Geyadrone Dihada** — *Unknown.* Last seen fighting Jared Carthalion on Dominaria.

**Huatli** — *Unknown.* Assumed on Ixalan, as Jace was stated to have visited Ixalan.

**Jace Beleren** — *Compleated.* Before he was completely turned to Phyrexias side after being injected with Oil by Vraska, He was willing to let all planes connected to Realmbreaker be destroyed along with Phyrexia if that would be the result of using the Sylex. Kaya and Kaito tried to stop him but ultimately it was Elspeth who got the Sylex from him after stabbing him with her sword. Once Elspeth and the Sylex disintegrated, he rose to join Elesh Norn and Phyrexia.

**Jared Carthalion** — *Unknown.* Last seen fighting Geyadrone Dihada on Dominaria.

**Jiang Yanggu** — *Unknown.* Last seen leaving Ravnica with Mu Yanling after the War of the Spark.

**Kaito Shizuki** — Failed to stop Realmbreaker from connecting to the multiverse and worked with Kaya to stop Jace from destroying it all. One of the last three remaining strike force members left face to face with Elesh Norn and her completed walkers.

**Karn** — Currently in pieces on New Phyrexia as a prisoner of Elesh Norn. His pieces were found outside the Seedcore of Realmbreaker. Koth and the Mirrans were working to free him when last seen.

**Kasmina** —  Assumed at Strixhaven on Arcavios as she was last seen there.

**Kaya** — Failed to stop Realmbreaker from connecting to the multiverse and worked with Kaito to stop Jace from destroying it all. One of the last three remaining strike force members left face to face with Elesh Norn and her completed walkers.

**Kiora** — *Unknown.* Last seen leaving for Zendikar after the War of the Spark.

**Koth** — After leading the strike team to the Seedcore of Realmbreaker, he and the other Mirrans stayed behind to try and free the pieces of Karn that were found. Since Elesh Norn must have past them to find the remain strike force team at Realmbreakers trunk, the fate of Koth is up in the air.

**Liliana Vess** — Staying on Dominaria to protect Teferi and provide back up.

**Lukka** — *Compleated.* Bonded with a Phyrexian beast and became one with it while fighting Glissa and Vorinclex. Turned on Nissa and Wanderer once he had fully submitted.

**Mu Yanling** — *Unknown.* Last seen leaving Ravnica with Jiang Yanggu after the War of the Spark.

**Nahiri** — *Compleated.* Gave into her transformation to use her power in order to save the remaining strike team members on New Pnyrexia. Now she is fully turned and faces down the remain strike team members on Elesh Norns side.

**Narset** — *Unknown.* Last seen training in Ikoria.

**Nicol Bolas** — Lost its spark and is now imprisoned on the Meditation Plane.

**Niko Aris** — *Unknown.* Had a conversation with Kaya after the events of Kaldheim's Doomskar. Not known what it was about.

**Nissa Revane** — *Compleated.* Travelled with Lukka for a bit before he was compleated, getting injured in the process. Unknown exactly when she was fully compleated, but showed up alongside Elesh Norn to face the remaining strike team members.

**Ob Nixilis** — *Unknown.* Last seen escaping New Capenna after losing a fight with Elspeth.

**Oko** — *Unknown.* Last seen on Eldraine, but left after being sparred by Garruk and Rowan. Probably making more people mad or something.

**Ral Zarek** — *Unknown.* Assumed on Ravnica as Jace was stated to have visited Ravnica.

**Rowan Kenrith** — Assumed studying at Strixhaven with her twin brother.

**Saheeli Rai** — After assisting with Teferi's time heist, she is returning to Kaladesh. Assumingely to prepare the plane for the war.

**Samut** —In hiding on Amonkhet with Hazoret and the remaining population.

**Sarkhan Vol** — *Unknown.* Assumed chilling with dragons on Tarkir.

**Sorin Markov** — Shoring up defenses on Innistrad with Arlinn Kord.

**Tamiyo** — *Compleated.* Showed up alongside Elesh Norn to confront the remaining strike team members in from of Realmbreaker.

**Teferi** — Started slowly dying in the Time Anchor after speaking with Urza in the past about how to use the Sylex. He has now appeared on Zhalfir where he has spent time trying to prepare and phase Zhalfir in and prepare them for the Phyrexian war. Met with the Wanderer when she found herself there as well and got the bad news update about the fialure to stop the Phyrexia invasion.

**Tezzeret** — Received his Darksteel body from his deal with Elesh Norn, but Jin and Elesh already knew of his betrayal. Tezzeret was able to escape before getting compleated and planeswalked back to Alara. He took Etheruim from his childhood home and tasked a boy he encountered name Estel to deliver it to Rafiq on Bant, just as the Phyrexians began their assault on the Plane. Tezzeret visited several other planes looking for a safehouse, but all were in the midst of their own invasion from Phyrexia. On Kamigawa, he met with Nashi (an orphan adopted by Tamiyo) who tried to get information from Tezzeret about Tamiyo's location. After killing some Nezumi bikers that protected Nashi, Tezzeret warned him that Tamiyo was alive and would come for him and make him wish Tezzeret had killed her. Tezzeret is now on an unknown plane, planning and awaiting his own chance to strike after the war plays out.

**Teyo Verada** — *Unknown.* Last seen on Ravnica during the War of the Spark. If the book is canon, then last seen leaving for Kaya's home plane with her.

**The Wanderer** — Went to Phyrexia with the strike team, but the instability of her spark made her planeswalk around. Last mentioned to have appearred in time to see Lukka fully turn and help Nissa escape. But with Nissa showing up compleated at the end of the story. Wanderer found herself on the phased out Zhalfir and reported to Teferi what had happened.

**Tibalt** — *Compleated.* Was tagged by Vorinclex on Kaldhiem and showed up compleated alongside Ajani in front of Realmbreaker. After fighting Tyvar, he was stabbed in the heart by his own tail and dropped off a bridge. As phyrexians frequently comeback from the dead, counting as alive until officially called dead.

**Tyvar Kell** — One of the last three remaining strike team members. Managed to fight off Tibalt but made it back to the others just in time to see the plan had failed. Face to face with Elesh norn and her compleated walkers. Still shirtless, but with Glimmervoid metal powers now.

**Ugin** — *Unknown.* Last seen trapping Nicol Bolas on the Meditation Plane. Assumed playing prison guard.

**Vivien Reid** — Returning to Ikoria to try and prepare the plane for war. 

**Vraska** — *Compleated.* Ended up alone on New Phyexia when traveling there with the strike team. Held on as long as she could before Jace and the others arrived to late to save her. Jace stayed with her to give her an illusion of happiness with him before she transformed and injected Jace with Oil. 

**Will Kenrith** — Assumed studying at Strixhaven with his twin sister.

**Wrenn** — Staying on Dominaria to protect Teferi and provide back up.

**Other things to know** -

*The plan to blow up Realmbreaker was on track up until the moment Kaya and Kaito saw how much the tree had already progressed. Jace still wanted to go with the plan to protect as much of the multiverse as possible, but both Kaya and Kaito were unwilling to risk sacrificing the connected planes.* 

*Oil could ALWAYS affect planeswalkers. The Oil would destroy the soul, spark alongside it however. This happened to Karn in Scars of Mirridon block. Karn regained his spark after the Oil was cleared from him by Melira and Vensor (who was already dying) gave up his own spark to reignite Karns. Jin Gitaxis’ research with the Reality Chip on Kamigawa was to find a way to protect the spark after compleation. Which they succeeded at with Tamiyo. So we see planswalkers in the story get affected by the Oil and begin to change, but they must go through Jin Gitaxis’ procedure in order to keep their spark post-completion.*

*We don't see much of this in the story, but it is mentioned that the reason the strike team make it as far as they do is because of Urabrask revolting again Elesh Norn. With Elesh Norn meeting the strike team at the end of the story, the result of the battle doesn't look good for Urabrask.*

*Melira, a surviving Mirran, is immune to being turned by Phyrexia. She also mentions several times through the story that she can heal and stop it in others before it fully takes them over, but it takes them “out of commission” for a long time. The infected walkers that deal with her all deny this treatment due to the urgency of the mission but it’s worth remembering for later.*

*We saw in Brother's War that when Urza used the original Sylex, he also disintegrated before forming back together as a Planeswalker. No clue if the same will happen with Elspeth, but its also worth remembering.*",337,0.98,136,magicTCG,2023-01-16,0,reddit
10byayw,Hasbro/WoTC needs to reconsider the way they're treating Magic's Lore.,True,"I'm an avid MTG lore fan and been following it since Mirrodin. Ever since they decided to publish stories online, the overall quality has decreased dastrically, with only a handful of exceptions like the Ixalan stories and some loosy tidbits like the one with Ashiok and Elesh. Despite those good stories, the majority of the lore has been reduced to rushed pieces here and there, never actually giving solid explanations to key story components or leaving some room to breath or even giving more character development. Online stories might be more convinient and easier to publish, but unlike a proper novel, they seriously lack consistency. 

The way they're advertising the New Phyrexia story arc (a huge, epic and important event for the Multiverse and even how the game is played going further), I strongly think they should treat the lore better, way better. Key pieces to the lore like planeswalker compleation is being left to one wonders how it's happening. The last three episodes of the current expansion just threw that glistening oil all by itself is already capable of compleating planeswalkers. How? Why? How did the phyrexians achieve this? It's simply not explained. Good stories are told from different perspectives with enriching details. Am I asking too much? 

Sigh, I'm frustrated by the way the lore is being handled. I wish things were different. (And sorry for my bad english, it's not my mother tongue).",335,0.78,193,magicTCG,2023-01-14,0,reddit

10dye6a,"The Phyrexian language font included on Wizards' ""All Will Be One"" website has errors in it.",True,"So if you go the [Phyrexia: All Will Be One](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/phyrexia-all-will-be-one) website and hit the ""Become One"" button, the page becomes compleat, and a bunch of Phyrexian text replaces all the English. The font file used to render this text is called Phyrexian-Regular.woff, and just like any font, you can download it from the page.

&#x200B;

When we received this resource, along with a guide to Phyrexian phonology and writing a few days ago, I started working on a tool that would allow me to quickly see the vertical Phyrexian for any phrase I typed in. It's basically just a stripped down webpage (not hosted anywhere on the internet right now) that has an on-screen keyboard to type all of the necessary Unicode characters into a box, and anything you put in that box gets rendered on the screen using the Phyrexian font. Plus it uses a built in setting that changes the text direction to top-to-bottom.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I've been screwing around a lot with the language for the last few days, and realized today that the ""word separator"" ligature doesn't always work.

&#x200B;

For context, Phyrexian doesn't have spaces. When you type a space between two words in the font, it turns into a ""word separator"". You can see one on the final line of the image I've included, circled in blue. You can also see, in red markup, all the places where I've labelled the absence of a word separator even though there's a space there in the text that I used to generate this image.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6jtu70ithca1.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07717cbec38e87f0be0cdae2be2bb3638780a268

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This text depicts the flavor text of the Phyrexian language version of Urabrask the Hidden. The corresponding Unicode text that generated this image is:

&#x200B;

>\^'uɣuφ mrodnqẅrɮwi'g <br>  
>  
>močtχi'əqsxen <br>  
>  
>'u 'urbraskχiɢɬčǩaaqq <br>  
>  
>tǥotqm. <br>  
>  
>\^'u 'asmkeqxǆuɣyp- <br>  
>  
>\^prosuj lo.

&#x200B;

...where \^ marks the start of a sentence, and <br> marks one of the places where it wraps to a new line. If there are any typos in this, they are my own. This whole thing means:

&#x200B;

>When the Mirran resistance arrived, the furnace dwellers looked to  Urabrask for guidance. His decree stunned the others: “Let them be.”

&#x200B;

There seem to be two things that mess with the word separators: Greek letters, and apostrophes.

&#x200B;

When you type a letter from the Greek alphabet on either side of a space (but not on both sides), it shows up as a gap in the text-line, with no word separator. This happened in the first line with the letter φ, but the Phyrexian font also uses the Greek letters π, θ, and χ, and they all have this problem. The marker will only appear if there are Greek letters on both sides of the space, or neither, but if the letter on one side is Greek and the other is non-Greek, it will simply show up as a normal space.

&#x200B;

Note that Phyrexian writing contains a lot of letters that aren't in English, but only the ones of Greek origin specifically trigger this problem as far as I can tell. All the others have never prevented the word separator from rendering properly.

&#x200B;

Apostrophes affect the font in a different way. The apostrophe is used to represent one of the sounds/letters in Phyrexian, so the font renders it as a full-on letter. But any spaces adjacent to one simply won't show up at all. You can see this in the third and fifth lines, where the space in between the word 'u and the start of the next word, (which begins with an apostrophe in both cases,) do not appear.

&#x200B;

In my testing, I've confirmed that neither of these flaws are the result of having the text in vertical mode, or anything else I'm doing. Editing the offending letter combinations into the original website triggers the same problems. It is completely impossible to replicate the exact look of the original Urabrask flavor text in the Phyrexian font without these errors occurring in it.

&#x200B;

I can somewhat sympathize with Wizards on this issue. Getting fonts to adjust characters dynamically is weird, and not all spaces become word separators. For instance, if they occur at the end of the line, they don't render, and that's completely as-intended. You'll notice in my sample text there is a space between the end of each line and the invisible ""line break"" character that does not show up in the Phyreixan.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, it annoys me that Wizards has released this font without bothering to test it that thoroughly. This is presumably a font they're using for internal purposes too. Who knows how many uncaught errors this bug has led to in their marketing / official promotional material?

&#x200B;

Does anyone else care about this, or am I just weird and nitpicky? Anyway, I'm excited in general for the Phyrexian material we're receiving, and would love to see more samples of the language to fuel the translation community that's currently trying to crack it. I would just also love to have access to a font that completely works, and maybe also has a dedicated character mapped that \*always\* displays as the word separator, just in case.",276,0.97,16,magicTCG,2023-01-17,0,reddit

10cm5ph,My biggest problem with the Magic story is how vague it can be about the worldbuilding at times,True,"I think in general this game has good worldbuilding, and good characters, but it can also be so vague at times

Take for example New Phyrexia, based on the stories so far it sounds like each Sphere is a wasteland (or a jungle for one of them), the landscape is dotted with occasional fortresses or temples, or laboratories, or a secret rebel base if you are lucky, but I feel like we don't get a sense of place, you know?

Are there roads? are there cities? Are there wild animals?, what is the vegetation? Where are the individual phyrexians? In factories? In work camps? Do they have houses? Are they just stored in warehouses until their next shift? Do phyrexians go to temples to worship Yawgmoth? How are the services? Do they sing? Do they make sacrifices? Are there pillars holding the spheres in place? If so, do phyrexians use these pillars to move between spheres? If not... How are they held in place? How do they move between spheres? Specially those that cannot fly. I  can keep going

And of course:

**HOW IS EACH SPHERE ILLUMINATED, WHERE IS THE LIGHT COMING FROM IF THE FIVE SUNS ARE NOT VISIBLE**

Tolkien once said that you can write anything, but you have to earn it. He said: ""You can write 'the green sun' but you have to make me believe on that green sun."" That phrase seems oddly fitting here since we have a green sun, and also white, blue, red, and black, but the story does only the bare minimum to make us believe in them",273,0.89,112,magicTCG,2023-01-15,0,reddit

As you are hopefully aware, r/magicTCG has a policy on leaks of ""Sharing leaks is ok, but we will not be the source of a leak."" We've a number of different reasons for this, but it's been the policy for a long time now. 

Leaks have gotten a fair bit more common recently, for reasons we can only speculate on. In order to keep things somewhat in check, we're adding a very minor addendum to the leak rules: ""If you are sharing a leaked card (one that is not an official spoiler), you must include your source."" Simply put, link wherever on the internet you found the image. 

To reiterate - Leaks are still allowed on the sub, the source just can't be here, and including your source helps us keep everything running.

Thanks everyone!

Oh and just to clarify a few things - I said on Twitter that the Reflector Mage had a legendary border because it was a self portrait, this was a joke and it pains me that people think I would be that egotistical haha. I thought they were changing it, but I think they had already gone to print so it was too late! And also I didn't get to choose these cards! I think that's to stop some artists who play Magic from building a highly desirable deck, maybe? Either way I love the cards they asked me to draw and I'm super happy with the collection as a whole! :)

10fttmz,"[ONE] I finished ""translating"" all the leaks!",True,"Quotation marks because those are quick translations for the sake of information. Spoilers taken from [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMwD0WNDSKE)

Hello, everyone. After spending the last few weeks telling everyone I was tracking the leaks, I decided I wasn't masochistic enough and translated all of them. By the way, my native language is Portuguese. Yup, I'm translating cards from a language I don't even speak to a language I'm not a native speaker of. God, that was tiresome.

[But I did it and here it is!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcJucTULIqR_qFyEJeAHiT3sPMy2qL7B4CMW9Nc7ypI/edit?usp=sharing) I skipped mana costs because those can be seen in the video by people in any language. I know its not ideal, but I did it at late night and finished it at 3am, so I didn't have energy to put mana costs too.

Some notable information:

\- Somehow, we still managed to not knock off all of Maro's spoilers. The artifact that adds loyalty abilities to planeswalkers wasn't in this leak (it's probably Ichormoon Gauntlet). So, congrats to the person that got that card as their preview! You're the luckiest person on this community.

\- TERRAMORPHIC EXPANSE IS RETURNING TO STANDARD! And entering Pioneer.

\- There are some powerful cards that generate Mite tokens. I'm scared.

\- There's a card with FLASHBACK!!!!!!

Finally, as I said, I don't speak Spanish, I only know the basics and the fact that it's close to Portuguese allowed me to translate the cards. However, I left many titles in Spanish when I couldn't do an educated guess, so, if any hispanohablantes can help me and tell me how much I fucked up, I'll be grateful.

10ddk4y,Is curing Planeswalkers even still realistic at this point?,True,"Most of the community, myself included, seems to think there is no way Wizards will corrupt so many walkers with no way of returning them back to normal. The lore is already being vague about how permanent this new planeswalker-turning is, and the candidates who are turned, makes it look like they will just be cured some point down the line.     
However, looking at the artwork for Vraska (and other corrupted) begs the question though: how would they even go about going back to their normal form? Vraska literally lost her legs. Will their minds be returned, but their bodies stay phyrexian? Or will they use plot-magic to magicly turn them back to normal?     
Personally I still hope they are simply uncurable, this is the big war, and it should have some real costs. I also find it hard to care about the story, cause I just expect it will be undone anyway.

As a Yu-Gi-Oh player who's just spent the post-Christmas season buying Magic cards, the difference between the two games is night and day, it's such an easier new player experience. For new players, Magic has:

- Arena Starter Kit, where two players get a cheap, full deck each to just start playing immediately.
- Jump Start, another product where anyone can jump in for cheap.
- Precon decks for multiple formats that are at least playable right out of the box.
- A focus on draft events, meaning even without a deck, if you know the rules you can generally go to a Friday Night Magic event and have fun.

It's far easier to just, as The Professor says, shuffle up and play Magic compared to something like Yu-Gi-Oh.

I'd be curious to know everybody's thoughts on this. Is my opinion just skewed because I'm new to the scene? Or are new players like me proof that WotC have a pretty good onboarding process?",178,0.87,128,magicTCG,2023-01-02,0,reddit
104mzyf,Planeswalker Compleation Up To Today (Spoilers),True,"So to keep track...
Tamiyo - Neon Dynasty
Ajani - Dominaria United

_All Will Be One_
*Compleated*
Jace
Vraska
Nissa

*Safe*
Kaito
Koth
And as of a leak today, The Wanderer

That leaves us with Kaya, Tyvar, Nahiri, and Lukka, with 2 living and 2 getting compleated. Any bets?

Personally I'm sold on Nahiri, she's a solid threat, fills in the blatantly missing Red mana, and I could see her powers being real useful for Phyrexian terraforming. Only reason i think she could be safe is because her facing Jace and Nissa would be fun and when/if Innistrad gets invaded having her forced to team up with Sorin would be hilarious. Out of the other 3 I'm doubting Tyvar because we've already got 3 Compleated Walkers with green mana. Not sure on Kaya.

Then we also have planeswalkers we know are going to show up at the very least in the stories of the next few sets, which include off the top of my head Karn, Chandra, Liliana, Teferi, Elspeth, Saheeli, Tezzeret, maybe Ashiok shows back up after his dance with Norn. I think most of these are likely to survive, especially after already having 7 Compleations and 1 death. 

We also have hints that Phyrexians will be facing off against forces from Kamigawa, Ravnica, Kaldheim, Strixhaven, Theros, and Kaladesh, so any legendary characters or planeswalkers based in those planes may be on the table too. 

Thoughts? Bets? Tears for the friends were losing along the way?


Edit: We seem to now know which planeswalkers are safe: Kaito, The Wanderer, Koth, Kaya, and Tyvar. So Lukka and Nahiri are either getting compleated or killed.

10c5du7,To everyone complaining about the gistening oil,True,"The current story is rushed, I agree. Spoilers below.

But the Oil has always been able to infect targets mentally and physically like a plague. But usually anone infected died after some time and rose as part of the Phyrexian Zombie Horde. Exception were Artifacts which became Constructs and especially magical beings that turned into Horrors. Only few kept their life and shape.

That changed on Mirrodin, because everyone there is basically an artifact creature to a little part. Now people that get infected may survive and keep a modicum of free will, but are usually corrupted to the glory of Phyrexia as well. Their bodies change in horrible ways as the infection can progress much longer and interact with their metal parts. Also, phyrexians can now operate on living targets much easier. Also, the dross fumes and the waters are corrupted, so everyone it likely to be at least a little more susceptible to the Phyresis over time now. Thats why Phyresis is progressing faster in this story.

Before the mending, Planeswalker were simply to powerful to get infected by the oil.

After the mending, Planeswalkers could succumb to the oil, but as they were not made of metal (most of them at least) they would die after a while, killing them and their spark. A good example is Venser, who is currently a Zombie.

Now, the Oil can still infect Planeswalkers, they still are dying. See Nahiri for example. But after much research with the reality chip, an instrument that interacts with sparks and a captured Tamiyo,  Planeswalkers can somehow keep their spark after turning. We know that the chip is involved because the Wanderer is currently having problems to keep materialised, which is usually connected to said chip. Also, the plane seems to destabilize planeswalking. 

Well, the plane had a shield by Memnarch to prevent Karn from returning to Mirrodin. The Phyrexians do have control over Memnarchs Citadel, so they can use and likely modify this mechanism. We know that they can because Karn can not leave the plane currently. Only Tezzeret, who is connected to the Phyrexians can travel freely. 

It is not just likely but completely plausible that all compleated Planeswalkers were in the process of losing their spark and dying until they got a spark stabilizing reality chip. As far as the story goes, Nahiri, Jace and Vraska are right next to a Praetor, so are Nissa and Lukka. Guess who is likely to own said reality chips?

So yeah, thats also likely their weakness. Remove or hack the chip and their spark is free again. But Phyresis is still there. The Hivemind is still there. Most of them will be too far gone, but I can see someone like Jace maybe resisting the Hivemind afterwards and if he gets healed fast enough, then there might be a chance for his spark to save him.

100lzxn,r/BudgetDecks Best Budget Decks of 2022,True,"The Upcoming 2023 year celebrates [r/BudgetDecks] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/) 9th year on Reddit! r/BudgetDecks is a subreddit designed to discuss playing Magic: The Gathering in any format or play style on a budget. Each year we review the best voted budget Magic submissions of the year. 2022 was no exception with many informative posts achieving a high amount of votes. 

About four months ago u/MonetaryMentor brought us an insightful conversation about [The Golden Rules of Budget Magic] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/x0tfae/the_golden_rules_of_budget_magic_10/) This list of golden rules offered ample discussion about how to build a deck on any budget, steps involved in acquiring cards and the deck building requirement needed. It was a well thought out post about some unspoken details in our hobby.

Our highest voted EDH deck was brought to us by u/GrazzetMTG They posted a [$65 Elas il-Kor Sadistic Pilgrim Aristocrat Tokens deck.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/ymu7sb/elas_ilkor_sadistic_pilgrim_aristocrat_tokens_edh/)

Not to be outdone, u/cardsrealm brought the subreddit [5 Decklists to start in Commander.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/ttu20a/5_decklists_to_start_in_commander/)

After each new set release someone often posts Saffron Olives list of budget decks. This year u/I_own_reddit_AMA posted [20 casual decks under $30: Dominaria United] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/xkqgyy/20_casual_decks_under_30_dominaria_united/) as well as [30 decks under $20 Kamigawa Neon Genesis] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/susb7s/30_under_20_kamigawa_neon_genesis/) and u/goldenj dropped [Saffron's 20 budget New Capenna decks.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/comments/ud7pwm/saffrons_20_budget_new_capenna_decks/)

2023 will no doubt be an exciting year for the hobby and Magic: The Gathering does not have to be expensive to enjoy. Visit [r/BudgetDecks] (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecks/) for more discussions on budget decks of various price ranges and formats, competitive to casual or various cost cutting topics and cheap alternate formats.

1051u98,[Spoilers] Current number crunching for ONE after all the leaks,True,"Hello, everyone!

After yesterday, we know 48 of the rares in ONE due to Wizards doing what they do best and leaking sets. The worst part, they didn't even leak cards that let us know all of the compleated planeswalkers, despite the fact we at least got to knock out another option and reinforce the W theory. (EDIT: NOW THEY DID IT!)

And you know what leaks mean? Number-crunching, of course! I decided to look at the numbers to see if we could find something more about the set.

[Here's the spreadsheet I made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcJucTULIqR_qFyEJeAHiT3sPMy2qL7B4CMW9Nc7ypI/edit?usp=sharing). I've used a color code to help identify the intervals of each type of card, so if you're colorblind and can't see it, I accept suggestions about how to make it more visible.

Unfortunately, the gaps I found are still too big for useful information... except for one thing: there's an empty slot in #205, right between Kaito and Kethek on the multicolored zone. You know what would fit perfectly there? Kaya. So, she's probably #205 and multicolored. And I don't know where to go from here, given that spoilers already proved that there won't be a mono-red compleated walker.

I believe something might also be possible by testing some of the first leaked cards from the Compleat bundle, but they're premium cards and thus they don't follow regular numeration. The best that I could figure out is that Necrogen Rotpriest is either #211 or #212.

One last thing: there's one rare absent from the listing, and that's Green Sun's Twilight, because its number wasn't revealed. We saw the BAB promo only.

That's it. Crunchers, I'll leave it to you now.

EDIT: WE GOT MORE LEAKS! I'll try to identify the numbers and update ASAP.

EDIT 2: As of now, 16:07 GMT of Jan 7th, the table is up to date. I'll keep updating it for as long as I can.",157,0.92,100,magicTCG,2023-01-06,0,reddit

10js2p0,Is anyone else disappointed with the art direction for the white Phyrexians?,True,"I know this is gonna get me on a watch list of some kind, but three of my absolute favorite card arts are [[Suture Priest]], [[Phyrexian Unlife]], and [[Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite]].  Something about the beauty and purity of the stark white juxtaposed with legit body horror really hits me. I was really hype to see what additional terrifying white Phyrexians we were going to get this set, but it feels...nerfed? Like WotC didn't want to print gory or otherwise body-horror-y cards? 

For example, compare the OG Elesh Norn to [[Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines]]. In the OG version, you can see the muscle around her throat and where her ribs are--and the cavern left where her other organs should be. In the new one, she just looks..kind red. There's no visible gore or body horror. I get that the red is supposed to be that tissue, but it looks more like just a red body suit.  

It's even more stark when you look at cards like [[Jawbone Duelist]] and [[Bladed Ambassador]]. Jawbone Duelist has a collar and a loin cloth made of the same substance with patterns that don't resemble any muscle structure I've ever heard of. Bladed Ambassador is similar, but with a cape? 

I guess I was hoping even just for more art like [[Defiler of Faith]] or [[Defiler of Flesh]].

I'm wondering if I'm just taking crazy pills. Does anyone else feel really underwhelmed by the white Phyrexians specifically? Is there a story/lore reason for it? Or am I just being an MTG boomer?",141,0.79,121,magicTCG,2023-01-24,0,reddit

Things like whining if something wrong happens (ex: I destroy a creature) or just generally trying to manipulate me for an advantage. It's a bigger problem when playing EDH than say a draft because it seems to be more effective with the casual nature of the format.

If I ignore it they get worse until I back off and if I don't they play exactly how I would expect. I haven't called a judge because it doesn't really rise to the level they would deal with but it's a weakness I have that I want to correct. It feels like the stereotype of a kid making a scene in the cereal aisle but I have no authority. I don't want to reward the behavior but I feel stuck. I'm asking for help because I could have unintentionally been a kingmaker in a recent game because of my reaction.

10ceakv,you ever wish Wizards would bring back unique gimmicks for pre-releases?,True,"Feels like it's been a pretty long time where we've had interesting LGS events like the heroes path from theros. 

I've thought about having a thematic gameplay variant for my group for the release of ONE but I haven't really had any good ideas besides secret partners, pitting the resistance against Norn's forces. Maybe try to work in some form of completion mechanic where the members of the resistance are slowly converted into phyrexians.

Anybody got any ideas?



Edit: A good day of thinking later and I think I've figured it out.

You'll need a 5 plains per player and a swamp(you could do this with any card but I find the colour just helps with contrast a little bit)

Put the stack of plains together and replace one plains card with the swamp. Shuffle up and deal 5 cards to each player, this becomes their identity. The player with the swamp is on the phyrexian team while the rest are on the resistance.

Phyrexians win by killing off all the resistance members or when all remaining players are compleated. Game plays as per normal, however when you deal combat damage you may do one of two actions.


Swap one of your identity cards with the player you dealt damage to.

Or

Reveal an identity card. You may choose to reveal one of your own or select one belonging to the player you dealt damage to.


You may only swap unrevealed identity cards. If at any point, a swamp is revealed in your position, you have been exposed and may pay 2 life instead of coloured mana for the rest of the game.

Whenever a player is eliminated, players perform a compleation check. Everybody closes their eyes. Phyrexians will then open their eyes to recognize who among their ranks remain.

This year I'm also introducing some changes to the post based on your feedback from last week. I'm adding a bit more audience participation into the post by including a poll so y'all can vote for what you think is the most exceptional card of the week. Then every 4 months I'll make a Top 8 post based on the weekly poll results, so we can really visualize what y'all think are the best designs. Should be interesting, and I highly encourage all of you to vote.

Now as for this week's cards themselves, we have a major focus on white cards with a few oddballs thrown in, as well as some of the standard-quality memes. Big props to /u/MDubbzee for making the Top 5 for their third week in a row.

I'd also like to give massive props to /u/Ladsworld- for completing their [2022be project,](https://www.reddit.com/r/custommagic/comments/100cqa6/the_2022be_is_complete_heres_everything_you_need/) a 365 card custom powered cube where one card was designed and added on a daily basis throughout the entirety of 2022. Ambitious projects like these are some of my favourites to come out of the sub and it’s always great to see them come to fruition.

First and foremost: how the hell can the 'evil' praetors, especially Elesh Norn let them get all the way down to the seedcore? Jace was SO close to ending everything (possibly). I simply dont believe the argument that Elesh Norn was busy with the rebellion is strong enough. To help understand this argument, why haven't they just written some part of the story from the different praetors perspective? So as to give us some insight about both sides, and possibly explaining why the most, damn important place on the whole planet is unguarded.

Taking this into account, it just makes Kaya and Kaito's decision to suddenly stop everything seem ridiculous and incredibly self-centered. I know about the whole 'endagering the whole multiverse' perspective, but it just seems so out of place. We have been told non-stop how Phyrexia is just the worst. I was about to write how it ridicules everything they've fought for, but they haven't fought a damn thing on New Phyrexia (of course, they've fought in previous sets, but this whole layer-after-layer seems so.. simple and shallow).

I love Phyrexia as a villain, their worldbuilding and story is so interesting, use it!

Next week, for only the third time ever, we at the [XMage Draft Historical Society](https://discord.gg/KMC6w55VJE) are going to embark on something truly ambitious and monumental: a complete\* draft journey through Magic history. All convenient, online, and **100% free** for everyone.

\*with a few reasonable edits…we really *are* becoming exceedingly efficient at it :)

I’m just as excited to start my third run-through the full MTG chronological progression as I was for my first. If you’re like me and believe that draft never gets old, the XDHS is the place for you. We are ALWAYS welcoming and happy to have new people join. And now is truly an incredible opportunity to start, with **3x BETA drafts starting again on Wednesday, Feb 1.** Unless you’re filthy rich, this is basically the only way I’m aware of to experience the full richness of MTG draft history in all its glory. And you won’t get another opportunity to start at this point for at least another two years.

When I first created the XDHS back in January 2019, it was partly (OK, *mainly*) for selfish reasons – I wanted to play older, long out-of-print MTG draft formats – and I needed seven other bodies to fill out a proper draft pod. I knew the XMage software was perfectly capable of handling the drafting and gameplay; we just needed an (ahem) *organized* group to schedule the events and get everyone to show up on time.

By some miracle, we got a full 8 player pod to launch with 3x Beta for our first ever event. I was thrilled – and I immediately knew I was onto something here. I quickly realized that I was not the only one who felt a gaping void in draft options for the greatest game ever created. At the time (and still if you don’t count our group), you had basically 4 options for draft, all with major drawbacks:

* In paper, organized by your LGS (generally current format only, costs money, doesn’t always fire)
* In paper, organized by a friend group (old sets *extremely* expensive or impossible to draft, hard to schedule a time and get enough players to actually fire)
* Magic Online (costs money, throwback drafts are scheduled at the whim of WotC, no real social community)
* Arena (generally current format only – even fewer throwback options than Magic Online, costs money, no real social community)

XMage solves all these problems – we can draft whichever sets we want, whenever we want, all for free – and, best of all (I ultimately realized) with an amazing community of friends.

As our little community grew, I increasingly appreciated the social aspect of our weekly draft rituals. The anticipation and buzz created by our world-class format guides before a new format hits. The pre-draft banter as we’re waiting for the pod to fill. The memes, the emojis, the inside jokes. The heartfelt journey through draft logs and deck builds. Unbelievable screenshots of game states never before dreamed possible in draft. Becoming stronger limited players by lifting each other up, helping each other out, being good sports and playing the long game of generally being excellent to each other rather than angle shooting for a quick TKO win against a nameless and faceless opponent you were never going to see again.

Over time, the selfish motivations I had initially dissolved away. This had become something much greater than getting a throwback draft to fire.

I am **SO** proud of what this whole community has accomplished over the last four years. We now have an amazing team of 15 people, and at this point, I can’t even take credit for 10% of the totality of it. I feel like a proud papa, and nothing gives me more joy than to see the group that I started bring two people together that really hit it off and become great friends over a shared love of this silly magical card game – even if they live oceans apart.

As of January 2023, the list of accomplishments is astounding:

* 1200+ member Discord server
* 800+ drafts successfully completed
* 400+ unique players who’ve played at least one match
* 175+ unique formats played
* 10,300+ matches played(!)

So come on down and join our friendly and welcoming draft community on our Discord server. We now host 7(!) weekly drafts, 4 of which are true historical draft formats, in addition to many other bonus formats and options to play the game for any time zone or busy schedule.

**TL;DR:**

* The XDHS is starting over its chronological progression with 3x Beta drafts the first week of February 2023 – a once every two years opportunity to join.
* XMage is like a free version of MTGO with a full draft and rules enforcement engine.
* Join our Discord to start playing today: [https://discord.gg/KMC6w55VJE](https://discord.gg/KMC6w55VJE)",156,0.89,10,magicTCG,2023-01-28,0,reddit
10fmbvk,"""Skirmish"" mechanic dropped from War of the Spark could be the new ""Battle"" card type",True,"MaRo discussed the Skirmish mechanic on the wotc mothership. There's a high possibility that the upcoming ""battle"" card type will be based on Skirmish, since Skirmish was fun and involved battles (but just didn't fit the WAR set). Mark said as follows:

&#x200B;

""...it's time to talk about skirmish.

&#x200B;

I often talk about how Un- sets allow us to play around with ideas that black-border Magic isn't quite ready for yet. One of the things Unstable let me do was experiment with an external component that got overlaid onto the game. (I'm talking about Contraptions.) This external component has its own function, but it creates some kind of output that interacts with the game. You spend time and energy building your Contraption, and then it spits out effects that influence how your main game plays out. There are numerous different ways to do this, one of which we explored in War of the Spark vision design.

&#x200B;

The idea behind skirmish was that we wanted there to be a battle between you and your opponent. This battle would be overlaid onto the game and would generate effects that affected the game. The second technology that skirmish used was first seen on the Monarch token in Conspiracy: Take the Crown. This uses an external card as a game piece that outlines its own rules. The cards that generate the Monarch token don't tell you what to do, it just generates the game component which then explains itself. Skirmish would do the same thing, which was to generate a Skirmish token, meaning any card with the skirmish mechanic would have ""create a Skirmish if one hasn't been created yet.""

&#x200B;

""The Skirmish token had a tiny ""game board"" on it showing a field of combat. When you performed one of the stated conditions, you advanced on the field toward the opponent's side. If you advanced enough, you won the skirmish. You would do this because there was a payout for winning, a generated effect. Skirmish went through a lot of variations with a lot of different advancement conditions and a lot of different payouts.

&#x200B;

The main advancement was tied to dealing combat damage. We wanted the skirmish ""sub-game"" to tie directly into the main game, and combat seemed the perfect flavor match. You were fighting a war, so clearly you wanted to deal damage to the opponent. The trigger only cared that you dealt some combat damage, so there was no difference between one creature dealing damage and many dealing damage. (There was one playtest that cared about batches of damage, so first strikers dealing combat damage actually got to advance the skirmish an additional time. This was not very intuitive and made first strikers a bit too strong, so we changed it for the next playtest.)

&#x200B;

The other most commonly used advancement condition was the casting of a card with skirmish. This was important because the first skirmish card you played started the skirmish sub-game, but we wanted later cards to be relevant to encourage you to want to play a bunch of skirmish cards in your deck. (One of the problems we had was this made skirmish a little more linear than we'd intended.) We also went back and forth on whether you advanced one for the playing of the first skirmish card. This helped offset wanting to play the card when the opponent had a chance to earn a free effect.

&#x200B;

Most of the time we had a third advancement condition. We tried damaging players with spells, but that rewarded red too much. We tried playing Eternals/Zombies, but that also only rewarded certain colors. We tried playing multiple spells in a turn, but that didn't thematically feel right. The one that felt best was advancing when you caused an opponent's creature to die, but this complicated processing combat damage. I just want to note that we spent months on skirmish and experimented with many variables.

&#x200B;

The other big thing that changed a lot was the output of the winning the skirmish. Part of the time we had either player earn the effect if they won, but also tried a version where only the person who generated the skirmish token got an effect. In that version, the opponent wanted to win to stop them from getting it. What the effect was for winning and how big it was shifted over time as we tried to balance them. We also experimented with a version where there were small rewards along the way and a bigger reward for winning the skirmish.

&#x200B;

We had a lot of interesting ideas how we could use various skirmish cards as a way to show off major moments of the war. We even talked about having various different skirmish cards to choose from. At one point, we had players going in order through a certain set of skirmish cards that represented the different stages of the war in the story.

&#x200B;

In the end, what killed skirmish wasn't that we didn't like it or that it wasn't fun, but it didn't capture the essence of what we were trying to do with the set""

10eo8yk,New Card Type Predictions,True,"The new Atraxa references a new card type: ""Battle"". Based off solely that, what do you predict Battles are?

My guess is they work similarly to [[Goblin Game]]. The battle itself is a permanent or possibly exists in its own zone. The Battle specifies some goal that a player must reach in order to win. Once they win, the battle goes to the graveyard. The winner gets some reward, and the loser might even get some penalty. Here's some examples:

White battle: At each player's end step, if a player controls 10 or more creatures, the battle is over. Each player with the most creatures creates a token copy for each creature they control.

Blue battle: Whenever a player draws their third card each turn, the battle is over. Each player with the most cards in hand draws seven cards and has no maximum handsize for the rest of the game. Each player with the least cards in hand shuffles their hand into their library.

My friend has developed a habit of free scrying on turn 1, and in particular, when the hand is a on the border of keep or mulligan.

What are your thoughts regarding a player free scrying to determine whether or not they keep a hand.

He thinks it's ok, I said it wasn't and now, I'm getting 3rd party references to show him, for better or worse.

For clarification, these are group games and no one has agreed to a free scry rule.

I see it as cheating.  Scrying is an ability and unless there's something granting scry, a player can't do it.

Part of the game is greedy or questionable keeps.  A free scry definitely helps mitigate what's an important aspect of the game.",115,0.79,142,magicTCG,2023-01-11,0,reddit

10a826o,Halo's part in the Phyrexian war,True,"I was reading the new stories and watched the video they released about it and noticed something in the art of Jace, that I didn't pay attention to, when it was first released. 

[Stabbing himself \(?\) with the \\""Halo-infused sword\\""](https://preview.redd.it/i7c2kspcunba1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=863dad91143a589780dc535222b5f7fa85f1768e)

Now that we already know that Jace has indeed been compleated the art drived me to think more about why he is holding the \[\[Luxior, Giada's Gift\]\] from New Capenna and why he seems to be using it on himself. We know that Urabrask has been in New Capenna studying Halo and since his alliance is against the Machine Orthodoxy it would make sense that him or Elspeth or practically both could bring it to the final battle allowing Compleated Planeswalkers to go back to normal offering a cure.

Now I m sure people caught up to all that already from the leaked art and all. What I want to talk about is the Legendary Artifact's abillity to turn Planeswalkers into creatures.

Maybe the big changes that will come will turn many (if not all) the Planeswalkers into creatures (thus removing their abillity to planeswalk) since they'd have to use the Artifact to cure themselves. 

Maybe it's the other way around, maybe a big event will cause the Planeswalkers to lose their abillity to travel (similar to the Mending) but Compleated ones will be spared due to their ""Mechanical"" nature and thus will retain their Planeswalking abillity after they have been cured using the Halo. I don't see such an iconic Planeswalker as Jace losing his abillity to travel the Blind Eternities or staying Compleated.",109,0.86,101,magicTCG,2023-01-12,0,reddit

10lhz2u,Looking for thoughts and feedback on a janky Balthor the Stout barbarian tribal deck.,False,"

Hi all! 

I'm putting together a fun, janky, lower power deck to play at my local LGS.  It all came about roughly a year ago when I discovered the card [[Balthor the Stout]].  I fell in love with the art and flavor and immediately hopped on TCGPlayer and purchased a NM foil, only to discover soon after that the majority of barbarians are utter trash.  So, I ordered a good chunk of the deck, found 3 different old border basic Mountains done by Rob Alexander that I adored and ordered 9 of each, then shelved the deck and never finished it.

Fast forward to last week, and I've been playing MTG a lot more than I was a year ago.  So I decided to finish up good ole Balthor.  A pleasant discovery was there were a few new barbarians printed and lots of the artifacts I wanted now had old border reprints. 

So, [here's](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4564611#paper) my list.  Thoughts?  Advice?  Any big flavor wins I'm missing?  I'm considering adding [[Grim Lavamancer]] as a flavor choice as Lavamancer is Matoc, the barbarian that befriended Balthor and recruited him to the barbarian tribe.  Only issue is he'd be the only non-barbarian creature.",84,0.87,47,magicTCG,2023-01-26,1,redd

We have done a lot of playtesting and believe its ready for open testing and would love you all to try it out and provide some feedback.

The main idea is that you can take any commander deck and with any number of players (including just one) and play against a wide variety of raid monsters. Currently we have 3 difficulties and they are in a fairly basic form but plan to add tons more of different raid monsters with a variety of different modes. The raid monsters all scale with player count, so in theory (and in testing) it has worked well with player counts 1-5. One of the best things about the format is the teaming up factor. I love playing commander but sometimes i want to team up and and slay some monsters together with friends. IIts been a blast for us and we hope you enjoy it as well.

Most of them are cheap, so I thought it'd be fun to collect them. I got more expensive ones through cracking packs (sealed/draft), trades, and gifts. Never spent more than $10 on any one card.

 Here's what I got:

100qsiw,Brothers War Set Confusion,True,"Hey gang- newbie to this group, so please go easy on me, lol.  I collected and played MTG hardcore from 1994 (came in at the tail end of Legends, and right around the release of Revised) through around 2004 (Darksteel).  I've only played and collected sporadically since 2004, but I had heard good things about Brothers War, and I wanted to check it out.  I'm also a Transformers fan, so that intrigued me.

My questions are surrounding the set composition and how many different kinds of boosters there are nowadays.  Firstly, what's up with these Set Boosters, Draft Boosters, Collector Boosters and Jumpstart Boosters?  Why so many different kinds?  Which are the ones that are most sought after?  Also, where is the best site to see a listing of the entire set?  There are so many different card variants, I can't figure out what a ""complete"" set looks like.  For example, I got some ""retro frame"" cards that aren't numbered like the regular cards are, so I don't know how many there are, and how they fit in the set. 

Anyway, thanks for reading- I also collect Pokemon cards, and those are so simple and straightforward to collect.  It just seems counter-intuitive to make this so confusing.  I am interested in hearing other people's thoughts.

TL;dr- why is MTG so confusing nowadays regarding set composition and card variants?  Where is the best place to get accurate, compete setlists?

If you're a visual learner, they offer well made videos that explain the topics, and if you prefer learning from text, they offer the same in plain text. You can jump around between topics in any order you like and revisit topics at any time, all on your own schedule. Again, this all 100% free. Plus, it's nice to be able to help out at your LGS.

[I've updated the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcJucTULIqR_qFyEJeAHiT3sPMy2qL7B4CMW9Nc7ypI/edit?usp=sharing) with the number crunching for ONE after the Building Worlds stream gave us a bunch of names to work with.

(I've added \[\[Duress\]\] to the main list because it's a perennial T2 card and almost nobody plays it in Commander)

But the good news is - I've got useful info! As we've speculated before based on the leaks, each of the Nine Spheres of Phyrexia will be a card. By number-crunching, we know now that slot #247 is one of those cards. But that leaves one slot open in the land zone! We'll have at least one land that we don't know about. It might be a simple reprint for the sake of smoothing Limited mana bases, but it might also be a mythic rare land.

zzz7qi,A Compleation Theory - Nahiri,True,"So, seeing as we know which 10 planeswalkers will be in ONE, and that 5 of them will be compleated (along with some - partially leaked, partially official - information about the status of some planeswalkers). I'd like to present my thoughts about one potential new Phyrexian.

Most speculation is presented in a Vorthos manner, so ""this planeswalker's story is at a dead end"" and similar ideas, which also points towards Nahiri being a likely candidate. My Melvin take (so focusing on the mechanical side) is that WotC loves doing mechanical throwbacks when revisiting characters and planes. What this means for Nahiri, in my opinion:

Two of four existing Nahiri planeswalker cards share the plus ability to make a 1/1 Kor (Soldier/Warrior) token, then attach an equipment to it. A mechanic tied to Phyrexia that likely won't be returning in full is Living Weapon, which also makes tokens and attaches equipment to them. I think that from a mechanical design perspective, a compleated Nahiri with an ability referencing Living Weapon's Germ tokens just seems too perfect to not be included. Of course, as the Germs are 0/0 tokens rather than 1/1s, i believe the ability referencing them would end up as a minus ability (Nobody wants a + ability that does nothing without an equipment), likely also tying into C15's Nahiri the Lithomancer, looking something like:

\-3: You may put an equipment card from your hand or graveyard onto the battlefield. When you do, create a 0/0 Phyrexian Germ token and attach that equipment to it.

But hey, that's just my little bit of speculating! If you have ideas about Nahiri's fate or such, feel free to share them!",55,0.84,30,magicTCG,2022-12-31,0,reddit
10l26c7,dug into how spelltable transmits video. This is why the camera really doesn't matter,True,"Was curious like everyone else if the camera resolution mattered, and I saw tons of posts saying it doesn't matter but I wanted to see what video settings they were actually using.

10eh2gf,The Fate of the Compleated Planeswalkers,True,"The title speaks for itself. I'm going to be looking at each of the Compleated Planeswalkers we have so far, and decide who's going to make it out of March of the Machines alive and well.

NOTE: This is written under the assumption that there is some way to ""Uncompleat"" Planeswalkers. While there is nothing suggesting this is possible at the moment, there are several things that suggest it could be possible, such as the fact that Compleation for a Planeswalker is different than for other things, because they retain their spark, and thus, their soul. So a Compleated Planeswalker is more ""themselves"" than your average Phyrexian. This gives rise to the possibility that Compleation can be reversed. Whether that process will be some magic cure-all that resets things so that nothing ever happened, or is simply them regaining their independence while retaining the changes made to their body I will not speculate at this time, unless it is relevant for individual analysis of a character.

There are five different ultimate fates that I think could happen to a character:

**Probably Survives Uncompleated** \- This is for characters who I think are so integral to the story and so loved by WoTC and the fans that the thought of killing them off would be unthinkable before now. These characters likely have several plot threads still left open, fulfill certain niches that are unlikely to work for other characters, or just in general have received a lot of foreshadowing.

**Potentially Survives Uncompleated** \- This is the category for characters who, while popular, are not necessarily as vital to the story as those in the previous category. They may do unique things or have decent popularity, but nothing set in stone; characters here could survive or could not, it would depend on the whims of WoTC.

**Unlikely to Survive** \- Characters in this category are characters who tend to have to fight for their role in the story. While they may fill certain roles, they aren't necessary to keep around. Their stories have come to conclusions, or their deaths would be painful for the audience, but not so much that it is impossible. This category is for the characters who WoTC could kill off at any time if need be.

**Probably Dead** \- Characters in this category are living on borrowed time. It could be argued that the only reason they became Compleated in the first place was to give WoTC an excuse to kill them off.

**Probably Survives Compleated** \- This is a spicy category that overlaps somewhat with the previous one. While these characters will probably die at some point, it may not necessarily be in this storyline; they may escape to another plane, where they will continue the Great Work, or, potentially, work for their own ends.

So starting in alphabetical order:

**Ajani - Probably Survives Uncompleated**

Ah, Ajani. We all wept when we saw what became of him. Tamiyo stung, but Ajani was really hard to take. Ever since Ajani was turned into a Phyrexian, people have been arguing that it would be possible to turn him back- even so far as in the story itself! It can't be argued that Ajani isn't loved by many, in and out of universe. But is that enough reason for him to survive?

In Chapter 5, Elspeth and Ajani had their grand confrontation. Elspeth was forced to fight her friend and mentor, and saw with her own eyes the horror that he had become. In a sense, Ajani's ""role"" in the story as a Compleated Planeswalker came to its conclusion there- the real drama that had been built up was the inevitable confrontation between him and Elspeth, the person he was closest to. It was their grand reunion, and under the worst of terms. It was the perfect opportunity to tragically kill him off, and break Elspeth even further.

But Elspeth didn't kill him. There wasn't even a moment of deliberation where she thought she SHOULD kill him, but decided she could not. She knocked him unconscious and went to go help the others. So why such an anticlimactic ending? Are they building up for a second showdown between the two of them? That would feel rather redundant. We already had the emotional payoff of their battle. They fought. Elspeth won. Elspeth explicitly knocked him unconscious.

I would argue that the reason for that is because Ajani is going to make it out of this alive. The fact that he survived the battle is enough proof for me. The only thing that keeps it from being a sure thing in my mind is the idea that WoTC could still kill him anyway, out of a twisted sense of irony. So close to being redeemed, and yet, he dies.

But basically, if anyone will be Uncompleated, it will be Ajani.

**Jace - Probably Survives Uncompleated**

Jace hasn't been in the spotlight much recently, so there's a case to be made that his time has come. In the ""modern days"" of Magic storytelling, Teferi seems to have taken the helm of leader of the Gatewatch and Magic's preeminent Blue Planeswalker. Chandra seems to have taken his role as poster girl of Magic recently. Even Kaya has gotten more focus than are awkward Blue boy has. So there's a lot of evidence to suggest that WoTC is ready to finally cut him loose.

But I'm not so sure. There's a really big threat still left untangled that, to me, gives Jace a decent chance of making it out of this alive, and that's Vryn. Vryn is Jace's home plane, a home he barely knows, even if he remembers it now. WoTC is aiming to do future sets on Vryn, and it would be strange to do a set on Vryn without having Jace there. I can very much see a storyline where Jace is freed from Compleation, and in his remorse for what he's done returns to Vryn to try and ""find himself"". And even if Jace is no longer Magic's poster boy, he's still a very popular character, and I don't think they'll kill him off so readily. His power suite is distinct enough from Teferi's where I can see both of them remaining, and I don't think they've done all they plan to do with Jace just yet.

**Lukka - Probably Dead**

Why is Lukka even here? No, really, why is Lukka here? You've got popular characters like Kaya, newer characters like the Wanderer, Kaito, and Tyvar, who have all made it out alive so far. So why bring Lukka into this storyline just to have him Compleated?

Because they're killing him.

I don't know what more you expect me to say. If anyone's biting it, then it's Lukka. Tyvar could be Compleated as a head in a jar next set, and I'd still give him a better shot at making it out of this alive than Lukka. Lukka, well... he's not that popular. He's got fans, I'm sure, but not many. It's clear that WoTC was setting things up for him, but I think the lukewarm reception to his roles in the storylines he's been in (aka, being a complete idiot and doing the exact wrong thing) have led them to decide to pull the plug. And honestly, I can't say I blame them. He's just a mess.

Let's take a look at his power suite. What does Lukka do? He bonds with animals. Okay, that's nice, but how has that been represented on the cards? Lukka's first card exiled creatures to cast, polymorphed, and his ultimate was a creature burn effect. His second card was creature-based looting, temporary recursion, and another creature burn effect.

And now he's in Gruul.

Frankly speaking, a lot of what Lukka does can be accomplished by the Planeswalkers we have now. Garruk, Vivien, Arlinn, they all play in the same space Lukka does, without any of the baggage. I can't for the life of me imagine why WoTC decided to include Lukka in this mission instead of Vivien or Garruk, unless their aim was finally killing him off. It's not a sure thing, of course. But if anyone has a good argument why Lukka should live, *I* sure haven't heard it.

**Nahiri - Potentially Survives Uncompleated**

Okay, okay, hear me out. Yes, Nahiri is my favorite Planeswalker, so I admit there's some bias here. But that's not the reason I included her in this category. Does it affect my judgment? Sure. I won't say it doesn't. But I don't think they're ready to kill Nahiri off just yet. Like Lukka, you could argue that the reason they included Nahiri in this storyline at all is to kill her off, but unlike Lukka, the in-universe justification for bringing her along makes sense. Metal plane - Planeswalker who molds metal. It's a no-brainer.

The biggest thing in Nahiri's favor, in my opinion, and what tips her into the ""potentially survives"" category, is the fact that, currently, she is the only Red/White Planeswalker we have. The only one. Ever since Angrath was introduced in Ixalan block, WoTC has always made sure that there is at least one living Planeswalker for each color pair. Several colors have two, some have three or more, but Boros has only one- Nahiri. I don't think they're going to kill her off just yet, at least not until they have someone who can fill her spot.

At the same time, there's an argument to be made that Nahiri could go in the ""**Probably Survives Compleated**"" category. I understand that argument, with a corollary. If Nahiri is able to regain her sense of self and strike out against Phyrexia as an individual, then I think it's likely she is in the ""**Probably Survives Compleated**"" category. But if she remains under the control of the Phyrexians, I doubt it. The most interesting thing about Nahiri isn't her power suite, or her colors, or even her connection to Zendikar. It's her morality, or more specifically, her moral ambiguity. Nahiri as an outright villain is boring. Nahiri as a complex villain/anti-hero/anti-villain is interesting and where her character shines the best. If WoTC is planning to keep her around, I don't think it will be as an outright villainous character, that's never been how she's been portrayed before. So because of that, I think there's a possibility Nahiri survives, but not nearly enough to put her in the ""probably"" category.

**Nissa - Unlikely to Survive**

Now, I really like Nissa. She's one of my favorite characters, and my favorite Green Planeswalker by far. But WoTC needs to kill someone off in a major way the way they did to Gideon in War of the Spark, and I think Nissa's time has finally come. There's a lot of foreshadowing to this; Nissa silently reaffirming her vow, regretting not getting to patch things up with Chandra before they left, all of it screams ""dead"". When they revealed that 5 Planeswalkers were getting Compleated Nissa was my #1 in terms of likelihood to be Compleated- she's likable enough where her death will hurt, but not so vital to the story that they can't afford to kill her off.

Nissa's great, but where is there left to go with her character? Her relationship with Chandra will never truly go anywhere. She's repaired Zendikar. She just doesn't serve anymore role in the story at this point. As much as I hate to say it, the most impactful thing she can do at this point is die.

It isn't just that she's reached the end of her usefulness in the story, either. Even her cards are redundant at this point. Nissa's main mechanics of land focus and elementals are things that can be taken over by Wrenn. WoTC has been putting Wrenn more and more in focus recently, and I think the reason for that is they're gearing up to replace Nissa. With Tyvar, she's not even the token Elf in the cast anymore. No matter how you look at it, Nissa's replaceable. And considering the biggest threat of Phyrexia is Realmbreaker, a big tree, I imagine Nissa will regain her sanity through the power of love/friendship just long enough to make a heroic sacrifice and destroy it.

**Tamiyo - Potentially Survives Uncompleated**

Tamiyo was the first Planeswalker to be Compleated, and I think it's likely that she makes it out alive. She has several loose story threads still hanging, mainly Emrakul and her three sealed stories. We don't know much about them, after all. But the biggest reason I expect Tamiyo to make it out of this alive is because she's a mother. I don't think WoTC has it in them to kill Tamiyo off because of how much that would devastate her children. Of course, this is not necessarily enough to put her in the ""Probably Survives Uncompleated"" category, because the writers are unpredictable. But given her power suite is unique enough, I think there's a case to be made that Tamiyo's story hasn't reached its conclusion just yet.

**Tibalt - Probably Survives Compleated**

Who doesn't love a good villain? I sure do. And Tibalt is great at being just the worst. The biggest issue with Tibalt, to me, is that he's felt too similar to Ob Nixilis in recent years, since they both share the Rakdos color pair.

But then he got Compleated. I think that's a pretty interesting direction to take his character, personally. Like Ajani with Elspeth, they made him fight Tyvar for a reason. And sure, it SEEMS like he died, but come on. Falling off a bridge? No way he died that easily, without even getting a card of his Phyrexianized self! If Jace can come back from being stabbed in the heart, I imagine Tibalt can make it out alive. He's certainly slimy enough. I can imagine him playing dead and, in the end, he makes it away somehow, and not as a puppet of Phyrexia either. I expect him to regain his sense of self, and continue hounding Tyvar and the rest of the multiverse for years to come. There's a lot of great potential in a Phyrexian Planeswalker who has no interest in furthering Phyrexia's goals, but only their own, and I wouldn't be surprised if WoTC Compleated Tibalt for the sole purpose of turning him into that character.

**Vraska - Unlikely to Survive**

Ah, Vraska. Like most people, I was pretty ""meh"" on her prior to her reimagining in Ixalan, and she quickly jumped up the list to become one of my favorite characters. Unfortunately, I don't think she's going to make it out of this alive. WoTC wants to make these deaths hurt. Killing Nissa would hurt, for sure. But killing Vraska? That would be tragic. It would break Jace. I can see the storyline. Jace is brought out from under Phyrexia's control, only to realize that Vraska didn't make it out alive. I mentioned before about an arc where Jace goes to Vryn to find himself, and I imagine Vraska's death would be a big part of that. I think that, of all the characters they could kill off, Vraska hits that sweet spot of ""not vital enough to keep alive"" and ""just beloved enough for her death to hurt"".

But that's not to say that it's certain. Vraska could still make it out of this, which is why I only have her as ""**Unlikely to Survive**"". Some of the positives for her survival are the ties she still has to Ixalan, and the fact that her power suite is pretty unique. While she's not the only major Golgari Planeswalker (thanks Tyvar) she's distinct enough from the others where no Vraska card could be taken up by a different character the way that, say, Lukka or Nissa could be. I think that's the biggest thing she has in her favor right now. But if WoTC is serious about raising the body count in this set and killing off a lot of beloved Planeswalkers, I think Vraska is one of the ones to go.

10e9new,Why is planeswalking not used?,True,"Am I getting something wrong? Planeswalking seems to be a kind of instanteneous movement (see: Elspeth, jumping in, killing Jace, taking the Sylex, noping out). As far as I know, it's also not traceable?

I do understand walkers not walking out when infected with oil, as they don't want to spread the plague. But in case of Nissa, she wasn't infected, she saw that it's a three on one with impossible to win odds. One could say that she didn't want to abandon the others / the mission, but those points failed equaly in death - or got even more worse as she joined the enemy team.

So.. she ran. Did she just forget she could planejump? Did I miss something there? Planeswalking only seems to be hindered in the way of getting TO New Phyrexia, not out of it. Seen by Walker blinking out constantly and some walkers discussing infection when walking away.

Also, where's the Phyrexian Planeswalker action? Even with Tamiyo, Ajani and Tibalt as ""only"" ressources, wouldn't it be possible to just jump from world to world and build phyrexian cells there to take over? Jump anywhere, place oil, wait for spreading. If trouble arrises, check if beatable, if not, go to another plane (see: untraceable jump). There's bound to be more than a few planes that nobody has on their radar to create a New Phyrexia outpost on. Even on their radar, how will they contain the oil in a city planet like Ravnica? A few drops here and there seem to be bound for catastrophe, no invasion needed.

Seems also like a pretty good plan a. Even if Realmbreaker failed, you just won 5 additional planeswalkers. Hell, you don't even need Realmbreaker. Just leak some intel that there's a new planar portal for invasions, wait for planeswalkers to arrive in your trap (an actual one, not a ""walk in this park until you reach your destination. We'll get you if your stupid, maybe), compleat them -> evil super team of extremly powerful beings.

It just seems that the concept of ""we can go anywhere, screw you"" and how to use it (effectivly) at all isn't thought about by anyone.",53,0.81,62,magicTCG,2023-01-17,0,reddit

103zphr,Small rules clarification - Altered AI art allowed,True,"Hi all,

Just a very small rules ""update""/clarification we thought it worth making clear. After internal discussion, and some pretty passionate discussion from the community, we've come to the following decision regarding our stance on using altered AI art for fan art etc:

We're ok with it, as long as the user has put effort into it beyond just generating the art. That could mean doing text overlays to make an altered card, editing and touching up the image to make it their own, using it as the artwork for a custom card (very popular on r/custommagic at the moment). This list is not exhaustive. 

Our intent is to reduce the number of ""low effort"" posts, which we feel typing a prompt into an AI art generator and just posting as your own is. We're not here to make judgement on whether AI art is ethically correct, or stealing, or merely a tool. Much, much better educated people have been arguing that for ages!

We do acknowledge that some of the community is very passionately against AI in *any* regard, and to that end, we're adding a sub flair - ""Digital Alter (Altered AI)"", which we request AI alter-ists use. Feel free to filter those out or just not engage with them, as you see fit. There's a pretty sizable chunk of the community that enjoys the altered AI artwork, so we'd rather keep it up if we can.

This will come into effect tomorrow, assuming I haven't broken the rules enforcement section again.

10elweo,GUIDE : Getting into the modern format and deck upgrade paths,True,"&#x200B;

[Modern is a complex format that can feel daunting to approach. This infographic will hopefully help new players in the format pick the right starting deck and identify upgrade paths to reach their target Archetype.](https://preview.redd.it/sediszbornca1.png?width=4875&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6306eb0e8fb4385555dd162834561e0706d754c4)

Decks are categorized by price range, type (aggro, combo, midrange and control) and competitive tier. 

Green big mana and combo decks are a bit strange to build since the common staples are usually sideboard cards or lands (boseiju, endurance, force of vigor, veil of summer).",49,0.84,15,magicTCG,2023-01-17,0,reddit
10drfkj,So. Elspeth,True,"With the ending of todays story putting Elspeth *somewhere*, the question of *where* arises.

I personally think, the beyond the blind eternities comment is infact true, and linked to an existing question.

She will end up where Teferi did, a place outside of time, the one consistency in the multiverse, the one thing that the blind eternities abides by.

It'd give Teferi a way back into the story and being caught up, and a way for them both to be introduced again, this time with Teferi knowing more about his chronomancy, and Elspeth tanking the Sylex likelt causing an Urza esque bump.

Now, this doesnt answer ""how they stop phyrexia""
But, i think yeeting it outside of time, replacing it with Zhalfir, could possibly happen.

But, unrelated, im ready for Kruphix to throw some hands when Theros is attacked, and for Elspeth to ewrn his trust in help due to leading the phyrexians to theros, the one thing he didnt want happening when she talked to him last.

And, kruphix knows all on theros...Who's to say that wont apply through the skars?",49,0.81,54,magicTCG,2023-01-16,0,reddit
10cps6t,Question: how did the praetors/phyrexia know about the multiverse?,True,"As the title says, how did the phyrexians get that knowledge. Is the multiverse existing known to the general people living? 

I’ve been playing magic for 5 years now, have seen some videos on the old lore and read the newer stories, but I feel like either I missed something or it is a plot hole, because from what I understood, “normal” people don’t know about the existence of other planes. Is it because Karn “created” Mirrodin? Were Dominaria planeswalkers jusr more about about that sort of stuff? Also, were do these new praetors come from? Any videos/articles/stories you can recommend because I’m getting hooked on phyrexia

I get the basics of colors, lands, attack/health etc but things like proper deckbuilding, the flow of things in an in-person organized card game setting, i'm 100% green

But they don't exactly... look compleat. I mean, Elesh Norn - the grand cenonbite herself - is fucking fleshy and bloody. Vorinclex also seems to be part flesh, part porcelain/metal. Jin gitaxias is definitely mostly metal, but it looks like not only. Sheoldred, idk, she freaky. Out of the preators, only Urabrask seems like he is full metal.

zyr1kz,Precon Scramble: A silly little format,True,"**I want to preface by saying** this format is and can only ever be strictly casual. This isn't an attempt to be the next Commander or Pioneer. It is simply a way to have some fun with your mates at the kitchen table or your LGS, and I hope you take it as such 🙂

So what is *Precon Scramble*? Put simply, it is a 60 card 1v1 format where you build decks entirely out of the many various preconstructed decks through Magic's history. If you, like many of us, started out by buying a preconstructed theme deck, intro pack, duel deck or similar, I hope I have your attention now. If so, here are the details:

For deckbuilding, you have five points. With these five points, you will ""buy"" deck lists of preconstructed decks from across Magic's history, with different categories of decks having different points costs (I will post my working point list below). You may buy the same deck multiple times if you wish, and once you have spent your 5 points, that's the card pool you have to work with. As with most non-singleton formats, the limit to how many copies of any given card you can have in your deck is 4, however if the deck lists that make up your card pool feature less than 4 of any given card when put together, that's the limit. For example, if you use a single copy of the [Metalcraft intro pack](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Scars_of_Mirrodin/Intro_packs#Metalcraft) from Scars of Mirrodin, you can only run at most 3 [[Galvanic Blast]]. If you wanted to upgrade to the full playset, you would also have to spend a point on another deck that features a Galvanic Blast, or on another Metalcraft deck.

To put it another way, you can imagine that you literally buy physical copies of your chosen decks, and the cards you have are what you can use to put together your deck. Your Jeleva precon only came with one [[True-Name Nemesis]], after all.

Now to the points list. The general rule of thumb is that decks with 60 cards are 1 point. Decks with more than 60 cards (either by being Commander decks or by featuring sideboards) are 2 points, while decks with fewer than 60 cards are 0.5 points. 3 points are reserved for decks where it is warranted by the power level. The reason why I mention my thought process is simply in case I forget anything. Without further ado, here is my working list

_________________________________________________________________________________

**0.5 points**  
* 30 card Welcome decks  
* Battle Royale box set (Individual decks)  
* All starter-level set theme decks that are less than 60 cards  

**1 point**  
* Block Set Theme decks (Mirage - Eventide)  
* Intro Packs (Shards of Alara - Eldritch Moon)  
* Planeswalker Decks (Kaladesh - Theros Beyond Death)  
* Archenemy precons  
* Planechase precons  
* Brawl precons  
* Guild Kits  
* Duel Decks (Individual)  
* Clash Packs (Individual)  
* Anthologies box set (individual decks)  
* Beatdown box set (individual decks)  
* Game Night: Free For All (individual decks, not to be confused with Game Knights)  

**2 points**  
* Event Decks (Standard)  
* Challenger Decks (Standard)  
* Commander precons  
* Premium Deck Series  
* ""Bait and Bludgeon"" 60 card theme deck (Affinity precon from Mirrodin)  
* ""Transference"" 60 card theme deck (Modular precon from Darksteel)

**3 points**  
* Modern Event Deck  
* Pioneer Challenger Decks  

_________________________________________________________________________________

This is my in-progress list. Currently, I am personally keeping an eye on a few decks that may need to be bumped up in points. Currently, the only preconstructed product I don't personally allow are Jumpstart pack lists, Gold-Bordered Championship decks, digital-only precons (with the exception of Mirage block) and Unsanctioned

But I want to close this post by saying that all the details are my personal initial thoughts. If anyone wants to try this, but wants to shuffle around points, ban decks you don't like, make it a Commander thing or what have you, go right ahead. What am I gonna do, stop you?

I just wanted to share a silly little format I thought up in my head 🙂

_________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT: I almost forgot to add the decks I've brewed so far:  
[Atog Clamp](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/pKLk3VwS90G07qVY8N-nHA)  
[Infect](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/tTNphugXIUq_DLQjEsROBw)  
[Slivers](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/m6HWkWTQGkyghuq8nhnGeA)  
[Spiritcraft](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/QV9SaEyU2EuicY7uTPkinw)

The first two decks, I believe, perfectly show why the precons they are built around may be due for some point bumps, while the latter two are more akin to my ideal of what the format should be: Janky theme decks that let the more novel and forgotten mechanics and tribes shine through (which, I suppose Slivers may not have been the best example of a ""forgotten"" tribe, but I digress lol)

_________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT 2: I have updated the Points list slightly.  
""Transference,"" the Modular Precon has been bumped up from 1 point to 2 points for featuring not only two copies of Skullclamp, but also generic cheap Skullclamp targets like Arcbound Worker and Stinger.  
""Bait and Bludgeon,"" the Affinity precon, has been bumped down from 3 points to 2. Making it 3 points makes even a ""fair"" Affinity deck (insofar as an Affinity deck can ever be ""fair"") practically impossible. The hope is that 2 points should let people play with the mechanic while also not making it *too* out of hand.

Lastly, I have been made aware of a few decks that may need a slight point adjustment as well, namely the Tempest Block theme decks for featuring a few very powerful cards, as well as ""Firebomber,"" a 40-card intro pack from M10 that features 2 copies of Lightning Bolt, which would allow you to get a full playset for only 1 point.",42,0.82,24,magicTCG,2022-12-30,0,reddit

105ei1i,[Spoilers] Did we correctly guess the compleated walkers?,True,"Hello, everyone!

&#x200B;

Wizards aparently saw [my number-crunching post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1051u98/spoilers_current_number_crunching_for_one_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) complaining that we hadn't seen the remaining leaked planeswalkers, and voilá! There they are. For those who haven't seen the leaks yet, Kaya and Tyvar locked the last oil-free spots, which means that our Phyrexian Gang is composed of Jace, Lukka, Nissa, Nahiri and Vraska.

&#x200B;

Right after Wizards gave us our first look at ONE and said ""five of those will be compleated"", I decided [to poll this subreddit on their guesses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/zlhavl/spoiler_what_are_your_guesses_on_the_five_unlucky/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) After I got around 300 votes, I decided to collect a first sample of the results. By a MASSIVE stroke of luck, not even three hours later, we got the first three compleated walkers leaked. Due to that, I decided that I wouldn't update the data I got for a fear that it could be ""contaminated"" by the spoilers. (In fact, if you go into the poll results right now, you'll see that nearly 100% of the votes after that leak had votes on Jace, in contrast to the \~57% of before.

Here's the data I collected:

[Forgive me for not doing a pretty presentation, I'm not good at that. If it avoids r\/dataisugly, I'm satisfied.](https://preview.redd.it/4m3og9a1hjaa1.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df42247aa440bfec2d6ecbb54483afdb47540d0c)

The important things here are: the B column is the amount of votes that each planeswalker got out of the 311 I've collected. The E column shows the percentage. The others are just a result of my poor Excel/Google Sheets skills.

&#x200B;

It's worth noting that, since we're using a 100% stack graphic, 50% is the average. Effectively, what this means is that there were only three significant outliers: Lukka, which most people gave as gone as soon as they saw him, and Kaya and Wanderer being the less suspected ones. As we see, we got all of them right, although not without some tension on the spoiler season - Lukka was almost cut back due to the first batch of leaks pointing no compleated walkers being mono-red, and the other two were put back on the guesses of many (me included) after we saw Kaito safe.

&#x200B;

As for the other six, hilariously the two middle ones, Kaito and Tyvar, were the ones that avoided the compleation. Nissa and Nahiri were slightly more suspected than the others and those suspects were confirmed, while Jace was close to the uncompleated duo, and Vraska was the biggest surprise, albeit not in a ""completely out of thought"" way.

&#x200B;

Overall, this guessing game was pretty fun. I'm proud to say I got almost all of them right (I only missed Vraska and Wanderer from my first guess), but I'm sure many people did well too. Maybe we know Wizards too well, maybe there were some logical choices, or maybe I'm overthinking all of this.

Kemba, Kha Regen = Kemba, Kha Enduring

10lv0wb,What are your plans for Toxic in Standard?,True,"I'm considering getting into Standard again using Arena when ONE comes out, as I would like to make a poison deck. I pretty much only play Historic Brawl, but I think support for poison will be too limited in singleton with the historic card pool. I am also very out of the loop when it comes to the current Standard meta.

Looking at the spoilers I think green and white would make the best aggro. There seems to be a few great combos like \[\[Venerated Rotpriest\]\] and \[\[Jawbone Duelist\]\] on the board and using \[\[Audacity\]\] on the duelist to potentially get the enemy corrupted by turn 3. \[\[Bloated Contaminator\]\] and some mites with a \[\[Noxious Assault\]\] finisher seems great too.

108tyuz,Which planeswalkers would make appearance in the Lost Caverns of Ixalan?,True,"It might be too early to discuss, but I guess it's never too late. (I don't even see its teeth.)

Planeswalkers in Ixalan block:
- XLN: Huatli, Jace, Vraska
- RIX: Angrath, Huatli, Vraska, Azor (as a creature)

Angrath was stuck there for 14 years, and left shouting ""I HATE THIS PLANE"". He wouldn't want to return unless he needs to.

Azor is still there, ~~and his spark is being used to hold Nicol Bolas on Meditation Realm.~~ Unless the barrier between the multiverse is somehow torn open, he wouldn't be able to leave the plane. ~~And he is still without his spark unless Ugin gives it back. His return as a planeswalker would have to involve Ugin and/or Bolas.~~
- Edit: looks like Immortal Sun is kept on Ravnica.

Huatli is the only known planeswalker native to Ixalan, so I expect her to make an appearance.

I used to want to see Jace and Vraska reuniting with the Belligerent crew. After seeing the leak of ONE, however, I'm not sure it would be a heartwarming reunion I wanted.",39,0.79,61,magicTCG,2023-01-11,0,reddit

10b7rf3,The Previewed Compleated Walkers Will Be The Issue....,True,"Marked spoiler just in case.

Ok, so we know Lukka and Nahiri are compleated but kept their Red identities.  For Lukka, that somewhat makes sense because he was solely Red before, but Nahiri being Boros instead of mono-White brings them into stark contrast with the rest of the Machine Orthodoxy.

I think the way this plays out will be Nahiri and Lukka end up challenging and defeating Elesh Norn and Vorinclex, believing they are who should rule their factions.  Lukka will beat Vorinclex ala Domri beating Borborygmos, Vorinclex will fight solo while Lukka will use his Coppercoat knowledge and the Phyrexian beasts he can now control to kill him.  Nahiri will beat Elesh Norn in Riddick fashion, she will believe that Elesh Norn having fear means she is too weak to lead, and when Elesh Norn battles Elspeth and finds a way to retreat from the fight, Nahiri will strike her down while she's weakened.

The downfall of Phyrexia will be in part because they left too much rebellious personality in Lukka and Nahiri.

Such is my 2-cents to make the design decision of leaving them as 2-color Planeswalkers make story sense.",39,0.7,70,magicTCG,2023-01-13,0,reddit

10j5goo,Won a game today !,True,"

So this is just a moment to gush out a little. I haven’t been playing magic for all that long but once my sister introduced it to me about a year and some change ago but I’ve really enjoyed playing commander. I’m only 23 and I moved out and across the United for the first time for school. I got into a great PhD program and my sister emphasized that I should maintain active hobbies when I’m on my own now so that my mental health can be steady and joyful even while going through the huge rigors of a PhD program. Anyways, when I moved we went to a game store together and it ended up my regular commander store. I had a pretty neat Angel deck but It seemed I couldn’t really break through. I’m a huge transformers fan(and a fan of big robots in general) so when the brothers war had transformers cards in it I KNEW I had to make an Optimus deck. My theme was artifacts and counters. I had some cards but it didn’t perform at the next time I used it quite well. It had good cards but it just didn’t seem to really run smoothly. Everything usually ran out of steam quick or I couldn’t keep up with other decks. Anyway, my theme of being knocked out early or being regularly dusted once players started focused down against me continued. My sister (amazing) was usually regaled with my tales of loss regularly then over the holidays she made this great gift for me! Through networks of her super awesome wife she reached out to a deck brewer. Not anyone that’s wicked famous but like someone who regularly competes and was ranked in a cedh leaderboard. My sister told them about my deck/ commander and they created a deck list commission for my Optimus deck! When I came to visit over the holidays she gifted me the list and I even got some of the cards at a LGS. Anyways, long story short this Sunday at the commander league I got a loss first and then I won! The deck ran much better and I even made a big play with vanquish the horde and allspark  (doubling cube). It just felt nice to get a win and then to do so with what felt like a really awesome gift. It was just a great feeling :) 

Tldr: won a game using a deck I loved that was vastly improved through a thoughtful gift from my sister.",34,0.7,6,magicTCG,2023-01-23,0,reddit

I personally could see a Ravnica Remastered in the future that draws on all three times we have visited the Plane.

Now before we go any further, I'm sure a bunch of you are already wondering about the leaks.  In the past, I've shied away from showing leaked cards until their sources are officially revealed, and that hasn't changed.  However, since WotC and Scryfall have both acknowledged their existence, I see no reason for me to not at least do the same.  For the first time since the Kaldheim Clues, I will be adding a section at the bottom for leaked clues.  These will be hidden by spoiler tags for those who don't want to see them, and the clues they count towards will still show up in the top section.  I'm hoping this works well for everyone.

With that being said, let's get right to it!

How bad is this problem with Magic? I’m sure there is some powercreep, but I hope the damage isn’t irreversible like it is with YGO. I recently played with some Commander starter decks (2022 editions I believe) and even those felt quite powerful to me.

10ew5fq,Theory: Elspeth's going to blow up Realmbreaker's branches in the Blind Eternities,True,"While reading Chapter 5 of ONE's story, I noticed something.

>""No, you have to do this,"" said Kaya. ""We have to preserve the Multiverse. All the planes Phyrexia hasn't touched are connected to the Blind Eternities as well, just like this damned tree—we blow it up now, we could wipe out everything.""

>""The emperor,"" said Kaito, sounding horrified.

>""Any Planeswalker **currently in transit**,"" said Kaya. ""All of us. I won't let you do this."" She lunged for the sylex, grabbing it with both hands. ""It's over, Jace. You lose. We all lose.""

So the Sylex explosion, when done near the Realmbreaker, could travel through the Blind Eternities. That's worrying.

> Tyvar staggered to his feet, pulling Kaya with him. Kaito had already recovered his balance on his own, and was staring upward, rapt and horrified. The others looked up and **saw the branches of Realmbreaker winking out in flashes of impossible light, connected to the tree but gone at the same time.** Tyvar made a small sound of dismay.

>**""They walk the Omenpaths,""** he said. ""They carry disaster in their wake.""

The branches of Realmbreaker are starting to travel through the Blind Eternities, spreading themselves, and the infection of Phyrexia, to other planes. That's even more worrying.

>[Elspeth] had time to glance at Kaya and Kaito as light crested over the lip of the sylex and a sharp crack echoed through the room, marking her disappearance. **The sylex went with her, bound for some unknown destination, some point beyond the Blind Eternities.**

Now the Sylex is gone. All is lost. Or is it?

**The Theory**

If the Sylex detonates as Elspeth travels through the Blind Eternities, it could destroy the branches of Realmbreaker, severing their connection to the other planes and even fry the Invasion Tree itself. This could also be localized to the Blind Eternities, leaving all other planes mostly unaffected and saving the Multiverse like Kaya and Kaito wanted.

I say that the planes will be *mostly* unaffected because I think the Sylex explosion could break open planar barriers everywhere, allowing everyone to travel to other planes like the good old days, and allowing them to join in the fight against New Phyrexia.

10bi5c3,"""Hidden Reach"" is one of my favorite informal terminologies in mtg. What are some of your others?",True,"To explain, ""Hidden Reach"" is used to describe a creature that somehow, inexplicably has reach and you sometimes only realize when it ends up blocking a flying creature and you're like ""Wait, that thing has reach?""

[[World Breaker]] is a one example I remember from some years back. Canon-wise, it's big enough to block flying creatures, but it's also in the same set as other big eldrazi like Kozilek and Endbringer, so it's easy to miss that this particularly Eldrazi has reach. It doesn't help as well that the Reach Keyword is somewhat hidden in the middle of the textbox amidst World Breaker's other abilities and might be easy to miss at first glance.

[[Meria's Outrider]] from Dominaria United is another more recent example, I haven't fallen into the trap of swinging into it with a smaller flyer thankfully, but I have heard of a few players that have done so mistakenly.

As for myself, I personally have made the mistake of swinging into a [[Bramble Wurm]] with a flyer.  Mainly carelessness and not reading the card properly on my end, but also because Wurm is a fairly common creature type in mtg and they are usually extremely large, canon-wise and also in terms of P/T but Wurms in the past typically didn't have reach in spite of that, so I just kinda assumed as well.

 \\1) Each opponent discards 2 cards, Mill 2 cards, sacrifices 1 legendary permanent, 1 enchantment and 1 artifact.  
\\2) Each opponent sacrifices all creatures.  
\\3 ) For each opponent, destroy target legendary permanent with the highest converted mana cost.  
\\4-5) The Raid Monster deals 10 damage to every opponent and 5 to every planeswalker.  
\\6-7) The Raid Monster gains 10 life and removes 5 infect counters.  
\\8-9) Until the beginning of the Raid monster’s next turn, opponents cannot draw more than 1 card or play more than one spell each turn.  
\\10) Each opponent sacrifices all tokens.  
\\11) For each opponent, destroy target enchantment with the highest converted mana cost.  
\\12-13) The Raid Monster creates 1+(X=DR) DR/DR flying, deathtouch, defender enchantment artifact creature tokens. All creatures attack each combat if able until the Raid Monsters next turn.  
\\14) Each opponent sacrifices all enchantments.  
\\15) For each opponent, destroy target artifact with the highest converted mana cost.  
\\16) Each opponent sacrifices all artifacts.  
\\17) For each opponent, destroy target creature with the highest converted mana cost.  
\\18-19) Each opponent exiles their graveyard and drains 2x(X=DR\*) life.  
\\20) Each opponent may immediately draw a card OR place a land from their hand into play OR gain 5 life.  
\*X=DR - X is equal to the number of dice rolled that turn 

\-Result 1 has had creature replaced with legendary permanent.

\-Results 2-3,10-11,14-15,16-17 were reduced to one die result and replaced with an ability that targets the specified permanent with a destruction spell. They have also been changed to all instead of X=DR. This allows indestructability, hexproof, shroud, bounce spells, flicker spells, ward and any other ability i cant think of to all to have a much better purpose. This also reduces the chance for a board wipe so it feels less wipey.-Results 12-13 has been adjusted to create DR/DR flying, deathtouch, defender enchantment artifact creature tokens. This makes removal much more important than before. It gives artifact/echantment removal a purpose. It gives cards like dockside extorsionist and the like a reason to be played. It makes blocking for the raid monster a bit easier to decide. This result is definitely the most contentious, as it can be difficult to decide what the ""best"" way to block for the raid monster is but so far its the best way we know to make the raid monster not just a big punching bag. Lastly it now provokes all creatures able to attack, this acts as a semi removal with the added deathtouch but also provides interaction with tapping your creatures with affects (amongst other things) to save them. -

\-Results 18-19 has had its life drain doubled to add a little bit more pressure on life totals.

In 6 games of play testing with 3 players it feels like the games are more interactive, have more decision making and are overall easier. We plan to have the baseline mode be about a 50/50 win rate versus strong precons.

But like, coordinated mischief like an evil villain group with a walker representing each color of mana. Here are our current thoughts:

Black: Ob Nixilis. Most likely the leader of the group

Blue: Tezzeret. Assuming he survives this year of course. He could also potentially be the leader. 

Red: Lukka or Tibalt, mayyyyybe Nahiri. 

White: mayyyyybe Nahiri or Calix? 

Green: Calix? Garruk? Oko? Vivien? 

We had some trouble with white and green the most. It could also just be an Ob Nixilis and Tezzeret team up, which could be cool, though I'll be honest I personally would like Tezzeret not to be evil anymore, want him to have a quiet retirement or something.",27,0.75,108,magicTCG,2023-01-05,0,reddit

10eec6o,[spoiler]About a recent planeswalking,True,"So, Elspeth planeswalked away while the Sylex was in the process of going off...she likely wont be able to jsut blast it off into the blind eternities, so where did she take it?

I have two theories:

She went somewhere where she knew someone could potentially quench such a blast. That would be Theros. As long as enough people believe that the Gods can do it, they can.

She went somewhere that would survive from being shattered. That would be the plane of Alara. At most Progenitus and the maelstrom would probably enjoy such an influx of mana, resharding Alara. Most of the Shards would probably even appreciate that. The plane is big enough, almost the size of Dominara, but contrary to Dominaria, it has a currently active blast zone right in the middle. Add to that, she knows the Plane, we saw her on Bant. Bant has a lot of powerful and revered Angels. Elspeth was hinted at being an Angel...she might reincarnate there.

And then there is my third, absurd theory: she traveled to Zhalfir due to the dispersion field of new Phyrexia and due to the blast. Now she can return with a very much ready Teferi in tow. They could even timetravel back to Yawgmoths times and convince him to hat what becomes of his legacy.",25,0.74,39,magicTCG,2023-01-17,0,reddit

10m9uos,"Dihada, Binder of Wills Potential Updates for Phyrexia: All Will Be One + Commander",True," About two months ago I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/yiwcnc/my_dihada_binder_of_wills_edh_experience/) showing [this deck](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/bxVlHjgAq0Wqv-cCAhFCCw) I'd played for Commander, and a month after that I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/z59m0s/dihada_binder_of_wills_potential_updates_for_bro/) with updates based on the new sets. Since then I have updated the new a bit but am not going to edit this original decklist until I've had more experience with the new one. I just love Dihada too much, and will likely make a post like this for each new set for the foreseeable future.

As always, we're mostly looking for Legendary cards here, but there may always be a standout card or two that you might want to throw in anyway. I also am constantly looking for any reanimation card I can cast from the graveyard. (I added \[\[Priest of Fell Rites\]\] into my deck once I realized it existed.) I mostly care about cards that work with the deck I built, but I will mention some possible alternate styles.

Going through these cards I was not really expecting to find things I would like but was pleasantly surprised. Let's get to it! I'll be going in order of their Card #s, so from White to Black to Red to Multicolored to Artifact, and then Commander deck specific cards afterwards. At the very end will be cards for other Dihada variants.

# Potential Dihada Cards from the Main Set

**\[\[Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines\]\]**: I imagine the price will be through the roof and I'm not even sure it's that good in the deck, but there are definitely reasons it would be nice to have. Honestly, though, I don't even want it as much as other cards on this list. Still strong af tho. B Rating.

**\[\[Mondrak, Glory Dominus\]\]**: Yes, all three Dominus cards for Dihada's colors are here. This is the first and is amazing. I think the preferred line with this in hand would be to +2 Dihada and defend her with a creature, then play this the next turn, use Dihada's -3, and get hella treasure tokens. You might even want to let all four cards go to the grave for an immediate 8 tokens, two of which (possible three) you will sacrifice for Mondrak's indestructible counter. Pretty perfect. S Rating.

**\[\[Skrelv, Defector Mite\]\]**: Cheap and useful legendary creatures are relatively difficult to come by. Being able to give a creature hexproof from a color at instant speed is awesome, and being able to use Phyrexian mana for that ability is even more useful. Making something unable to be blocked could also be game winning, but less of a priority imo. I'd rather keep it untapped during my opponent's turns in most situations. A Rating.

**\[\[Drivnod, Carnage Dominus\]\]**: While many cards in a Dihada deck can be switched out, I feel like the Neon Kamigawa Dragon Spirits are there to stay (especially with \[\[Magda, Brazen Outlaw\]\], and this thing makes each of them insane, especially \[\[Junji, the Midnight Sky\]\]'s reanimation effect. As if that wasn't incentive enough, you can instant speed and with Phyrexian Mana make it permanently indestructible? And you're playing Dihada, so it's not like getting cards in the graveyard is especially difficult. Once it has indestructible, the board clears get even more effective, as you keep even more things beside's Dihada's +2 target. S Rating.

**\[\[Vraska, Betrayal's Sting\]\]**: I don't think I have to talk about this card much. Drawing cards and nullifying creatures is great, and Proliferation is actually a huge ability since you're playing a Planeswalker for a Commander. S Rating.

**\[\[Capricious Hellraiser\]\]**: I mainly like this card because it's a reanimation effect on a creature, which we love with cards like Junji and Olivia, but also it's a Dragon type, allowing it to be searchable by Magda. Even casting it doesn't seem that bad since you get access to treasures with Dihada. Imo, you actually *don't* want it to get the cost reduction. Six mana is pretty fair for a reanimation effect, but more importantly you're probably going to dump a decent amount of land in the graveyard with Dihada, so the random exiling may be frustrating. The earlier you play it, the more control you have over hitting the intended target. The longer the game goes on, however, the more land you'll have exiled with its effect, assuming you get to play it multiple times (possible with Olivia, though Junji cannot reanimate Dragons, sadly). A+/S- Rating

**\[\[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus\]\]**: Another Dominus that can become indestructible, perfect for our board clear gameplay, and all it takes is discarding cards? Easy for Dihada. In fact, I can even see a situation where you use its discard a second time if you're about to play a \[\[Primevals' Glorious Rebirth\]\]. Its cheap and useful nature makes it viable, imo, even without its static effect, but let's be real here, I want that \[\[Heartless Hidetsugu\]\] dream. I think I've taken \[\[Ashling the Pilgrim\]\] out for now but that's also still a great combo, especially with Dihada giving it indestructible when it pops off. And then you've also got Olivia's pinging. Not as strong as the other Dominus cards but an indestructible legendary with potential upside is cool no matter what. A Rating.

**\[\[Kaya, Intangible Slayer\]\]**: This card is just nuts. I know that when it was spoiled people did not seem to like the high mana cost, but it seems warranted. Also keep in mind that it isn't as expensive in a multiplayer game of commander, not to mention you get access to treasure with Dihada. It also has use in the lifegain variant I mentioned in the last post. S Rating.

**\[\[Kethek, Crucible Goliath\]\]**: Honestly I'm not sure how the deck would use him but it's fun to theorycraft. Let me know your ideas! ??? Rating

**\[\[Nahiri, the Unforgiving\]\]**: I love hand fixing, and this is on a legendary planeswalker you can cast as soon as turn three, and all the while it *gains* loyalty doing it. I'm not a huge fan of the 0 and its exiling effect, but it could be useful in a pinch I guess. B Rating.

**\[\[The Filigree Sylex\]\]**: Another legendary board wipe! Not as good as last set's Sylex since you're probably not going to use it immediately (unless you need to kill a token or tokens\~) but it's still a decent card to draft with Dihada seeing as it's only two mana. A Rating

**\[\[Mirran Safehouse\]\]**: The first non-legendary card on the list. You won't get to keep this with Dihada, but you also don't get to keep any of your rocks, which is basically what this is. It has the added bonus of your other activated abilities, though! Sometimes you must \[\[Cleansing Nova\]\] for artifacts and enchantments and lose your rocks and it feels horrible, but with a sac land in your graveyard that isn't a problem for this thing. Plus there's tons of other uses. The original Ravnica dual lands can tap for two mana! The DND rare lands are manlands. \[\[Tyrite Sanctum\]\] is probably one of my favorites, too. A Rating.

**\[\[Staff of Compleation\]\]**: Similar to Mirran Safehouse above, this isn't legendary and is more like a rock, but what a rock! Proliferation to help Dihada get more counters, or even just straight up drawing cards, this card is nutty. With Dihada's ability to give lifelink to things, the life loss isn't likely to hurt you as much as you might think, and is likely worth it. A Rating.

# Potential Dihada Cards from Commander

**\[\[Norn's Decree\]\]**: Not a legendary but seems pretty insane for commander games. Even with just the first ability, you could theoretically make it hard for some decks to kill you without dying first since you have decent lifelink with Dihada. Now factor in both abilities and it's hard to justify attacking you. Once someone gets that poison counter they could be focused by the entire table. Fricking yikes. A Rating.

**\[\[Elspeth Tirel\]\]**: Not a new card but an extremely useful card, especially eyeing that -5. It's especially relevant that, while it would kill Dihada, it would not kill treasure tokens, so summoning her back could be easy. Her -2 is great for defending planeswalkers, including your commander, and the +2 works with Dihada's lifelink. Especially good if you're going with last post's lifelink strategy. S Rating.

**\[\[Otharri, Suns' Glory\]\]**: This card does pretty much everything you want. While Olivia and Junji are resilient, they're not necessarily game winning. This, one the other hand, is a great third piece. Also, how many times do you get to see the pluralized possessive ***Suns'*** on a card? Dope. S Rating.

**\[\[Idol of Oblivion\]\]**: Okay so I did not know this card existed. Excellent in combination with Dihada's -3, which creates treasure tokens and allows you to draw with this thing. Also good with the two cards above this. B Rating.

**\[\[Slayers' Stronghold\]\]**: Not a legendary land and also a reprint, but I have renewed interest with something like Mirran Safehouse existing. B Rating.

# Other Dihada Variants - Lifegain

**\[\[Vraan, Executioner Thane\]\]**: I already mentioned that some of the above cards were good in the theoretical lifelink list, but this is the only one I think doesn't cut my version and is solely good for the lifegain version. It's cheap, legendary, and can gain life.

**\[\[White Sun's Twilight\]\]**: Still loving board wipes with Dihada, but this one comes with creatures, which is cool, and also gains you life! Not legendary, but a very strong board wipe for lifegain.

**\[\[Fumigate\]\]**: A reprint, but a decent board wipe for lifegain.

# Other Dihada Variants - Tokens

The new commander decks certainly have some decent cards geared towards tokens, and including the ridiculous white Dominus from the main set would be terrifying. There's also Elspeth, Otharri, and Idol of Oblivion from a few mentions ago. I'm not sure how viable this variant would be, but here are some potentials if you're interested in that. 

**\[\[White Sun's Twilight\]\]**: Still loving board wipes with Dihada, but this one comes with tokens, which the deck seems to want to do. And lifegain isn't bad.

**\[\[Ria Ivor, Bane of Bladehold\]\]**: This card both generates tokens and pumps them. Hard to hate it.

**\[\[Graaz, Unstoppable Juggernaut\]\]**: Probably the biggest reason to keep Magda in the deck, this with a bunch of tokens is bananas.

**\[\[Prava of the Steel Legion\]\]**: A reprint I believe, but yeah pretty good, especially with Graaz above, just in case you were worried about your 5/3s being too weak...

**\[\[Neyali, Suns' Vaguard\]\]**: Yeah there are definitely some powerful legendary cards for tokens. Feel free to brainstorm.

10jqerf,What unresolved story threads are going to be left after MOM?,True,"I've been following the story somewhat passively for years, and have a question about what's going to be coming out of MOM. Are there any planeswalkers (or other major lore characters) with substantially unresolved stories? 

It feels like the past decade or so of magic has mainly had three long-running stories: The Eldrazi, Nicol Bolas, and the Phyrexians. Sure, there have been little side stories (strixhaven, Eldraine) or planeswalker/character vignettes within bigger stories (Angrath on Ixalan), but for the most part, the dangling threads after each story resolved fed back into one of those plots. 

And then, in 2016, we put the Eldrazi plot to bed and have barely revisited it since. Emrakul is asleep in the moon and might wake up some day, but who knows for sure. And in 2019, Nicol Bolas goes bye-bye, trapped away from the action fairly securely. Both of these plots have some hints of ways out, but no characters actively pursuing said way out. And in the background of those stories, there was always the threat of the Phyrexians, which both we and some of the planeswalkers knew were out there, building, planning, scheming. 

But now, what's left? As far as I can tell, there are no other potential big multiversal baddies left. No other epic scale villains left to switch focus to after the Phyrexians win or lose.  So I ask you: What's still out there? What Planeswalkers have major unresolved narrative threads? What, if anything, provides the impetus for a story across blocks to move forward right now?

(Yes, I know that the theory is that the big lore change is enabling non-planeswalkers to have multiversal access, but folks still need a reason to be out there in the multiverse. What reasons are left, and for who, other than 'we were bored and needed an activity'?)",21,0.8,54,magicTCG,2023-01-23,0,reddit

For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.

We encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.

**Rules Questions**

Rules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).

**Deckbuilding Questions**

If you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.

Additionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as ""what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?"", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.

**Commonly Asked Questions**

* *I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?*

Don't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call ""The List"".

You can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website.

10e5uj9,My uneducated slap-dash critique of ONE story,True,"So, I'm just gonna show my ass and shoot from the hip about ONE. 

It felt rushed. IDK if that's strictly from release speed but I think plot advancement choices were pretty questionable too.

So, what was ONE's story supposed to accomplish; Get some planeswalker doing a ""dirty dozen""/""suicide squad"" story, have Realmbreaker burst into the multiverse and have a phyrexian invasion to set up MoM

Which, that was accomplished, but probably be tighter as a story.

The pace of compleation against expectations was dissonant. As far as I read & watched background, compleation involved surgeries. In the story it just was happening. Flesh transmogrified and people just turned into phyrexians, like a techno-organic virus from X-Men's Cable

Story 1 really could have been better. It's purpose was get Nahiri infected. The story angle of separating the party was a bad choice. When the party's separated you need more story to highlight everyone. The story was not going to have the chapters needed for that.

Case in pint; Vraska was essentially fridged. Her entire role was to be there to be a point of emotional drama for Jace. 

The Wanderer; No purpose for her, yet. Her contributions could just as well have been done by other characters.

Truthfully, you could have nixed chapter 1 and start from chapter 2 and still get your plot points. You could have not separated the party and still get your points. Chapter 1; Meet in furnace and start mission. Chapter 2; Hunter maze and lose Lukka and Nissa.

Chapter 3; sure bypass surgical layer to get to Dross pits, and have Nahiri and Vraska fall. 

Chap 4 and 5 seem ok at the moment.

Missed story opportunity; Sheoldred joining Urabrask's rebellion. We have nothing about the phyrexians warring against each other. That's a totally lost story right there.

So, look, the major beats are fine. The execution of them was bad and needlessly added a sense of dismaying whiplash to get to them. Stories of planar wars require more story to cover the scope of the conflict's stage.

Dominaria btw was another example of this. It's scope of story could not be met with it's page count. And it wasted page count on some plot that was too small in scope from it's story (The opening with Karn, The story of being trapped in the tower)

Brothers War was a good story. It was localized to the Gate Watch base. Teferri was meant to buzz across time quickly and haphazardly. The localization to the Gate Watch base worked for the page count to have good pacing.",20,0.65,48,magicTCG,2023-01-17,0,reddit
10drqre,Imagination > Wallet,True,"I personally don't use proxy cards and I like having the real card because I'm a bit of a collector. I like holding the real card because it makes me feel more attached to it, and I can afford to say these things (by ""afford"" I mean I can get a dockside extortionist every so often, definitely not a gaea's cradle).

HOWEVER

Half of my friend group uses proxies and it's a blast playing against so many different deck types that they bring in because they can afford them. Sure it's annoying sometimes that they proxy every counterspell under the sun, but it's actually made me a stronger player since I've been learning how to play around heavy counter decks, or super strong infinite decks, or just wacky artifact decks. We'll communicate what we want to play so that we use decks that are power appropriate (none of us are CEDH level so our power levels are all over the place anyways). PLUS some of the decks they've had custom-printed have been super entertaining to play against. I've seen so many themed decks:

-Adventure Time
-Harry Potter
-Star Wars
-One Piece (I want this deck!)
-Godzilla

The point of magic, for me, is to have a good time, and even if players like me don't like using proxies that doesn't mean that others SHOULDN'T use them. I don't want someone's imagination limited by their wallet.

So please proxy cards if the price wall is what's stopping you from playing. Obviously get with your local game store (LGS) to see how they feel about them, but most casual players and game settings don't care.",20,0.7,16,magicTCG,2023-01-16,0,reddit

1. No stores or dealers selling on here.  We won't stop stores from responding to sell posts with buy offers, though. At that point, it's up to the seller to accept or reject the offer.  

2. Do not spam this thread. Your sell/trade offer(s) should be confined to one post per week. If you list multiple cards as separate orders, or multiple lots of cards as separate orders, do so in the same post with a clear delineation. As a seller, you may post whether you want offers within the thread or whether you want a private message. If you want to make this different for different listings, that's your prerogative. State what country you're shipping from and include shipping price+method for your own country. If you are willing to ship to other countries, say so. 

3. **No eBay posts.**

4.  If a card is sold/traded, edit your post and invalidate any pending offers for that card. ""Short selling"" is not acceptable here, since we're dealing in physical goods and shipping times may be an issue, especially if the buyer is a tournament player. Do not short sell cards.

5.  Buyers: Post your offer directly underneath a sell listing, unless you are topping someone else's offer, in which case you should post directly underneath that offer.

6.  Buyers: Feel free to post a ""want"" list. 

7.  For the sake of preventing identity theft and/or harassment, do NOT post identifying information (name, address, paypal info) in the thread.

8.  No throwaway accounts.

9.  Needless to say, we're Magic players. We don't necessarily have to pay in cash. It's entirely up to the seller whether to consider ""2 Force of Will"" as a higher/lower bid than $160.

10.  There is also a deckbox.org trading area that can be used as well, at

If you are, maybe you’re wondering what other cards you can play to help stem the tide against graveyard decks. In this article, I’m going to list some of my favorite anti-graveyard cards. Some of them even have upsides beyond simply stopping graveyard strategies. Isn’t that exciting?

I hope that you enjoy the article. I think that graveyard hate is an important consideration these days when nearly every deck uses the graveyard in some way and many decks outright abuse it without repercussion. Once you've read the article, let me know if there are there any cool graveyard hate cards that you think that I've missed!

10dbzrg,Weekly trading thread -- trade with your fellow redditors!,True,"RULES:

1. No stores or dealers selling on here.  We won't stop stores from responding to sell posts with buy offers, though. At that point, it's up to the seller to accept or reject the offer.  

2. Do not spam this thread. Your sell/trade offer(s) should be confined to one post per week. If you list multiple cards as separate orders, or multiple lots of cards as separate orders, do so in the same post with a clear delineation. As a seller, you may post whether you want offers within the thread or whether you want a private message. If you want to make this different for different listings, that's your prerogative. State what country you're shipping from and include shipping price+method for your own country. If you are willing to ship to other countries, say so. 

3. **No eBay posts.**

4.  If a card is sold/traded, edit your post and invalidate any pending offers for that card. ""Short selling"" is not acceptable here, since we're dealing in physical goods and shipping times may be an issue, especially if the buyer is a tournament player. Do not short sell cards.

5.  Buyers: Post your offer directly underneath a sell listing, unless you are topping someone else's offer, in which case you should post directly underneath that offer.

6.  Buyers: Feel free to post a ""want"" list. 

7.  For the sake of preventing identity theft and/or harassment, do NOT post identifying information (name, address, paypal info) in the thread.

8.  No throwaway accounts.

9.  Needless to say, we're Magic players. We don't necessarily have to pay in cash. It's entirely up to the seller whether to consider ""2 Force of Will"" as a higher/lower bid than $160.

10.  There is also a deckbox.org trading area that can be used as well, at 
http://deckbox.org/communities/reddit_mtg_trades.

If you have any comments about the rules rather than about a particular auction, feel free to discuss them here.

10l6bxb,Getting full txt Set lists from Scryfall.,True,"I wanted to share this snippit I made today. I searched for ways earlier on how to grab full txt spoilers from scryfall. Most of the response were good, and made use of the api, but one of the main issues was that a response only brought back 175 cards at a time. So I took sometime to write a powershell script to grab every card from a set, format it how I want, output it to a file. In my case, Im using it in Archidekt to keep track of my collection based on sets, similar to a checklist.  

I know this may be trivial to some, and useless to others. But to the few looking for this functionality, I hope this serves as a decent base to get started with.

I can’t find it anywhere. Has it actually been released? Can you share the contents?

**WotC:**

Hello,  
Thank you for contacting Wizards of the Coast Customer Support!   
Unfortunately, we aren't able to offer assistance directly with this question on the contents of the Welcome Boosters for sale with the Brothers' War set beyond what is mentioned in the article that you found: [What's Inside the Brothers' War Boosters?](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/whats-inside-the-brothers-war-boosters)  
 

However, the wider internet has several good resources that may be able to aid in answering your question. We would recommend seeking those out, or alternatively, as the article you linked encouraged, we would recommend taking this question to your local Wizards Play Network Store as they can be useful when investigating these sorts of questions and letting you know what they have on offer for their Welcome Boosters and what they've found comes inside them. To find a Wizards Play Network Store, you can use our store locator [here](https://locator.wizards.com/).  
 

I’ll be glad to help you further if you have any other questions or concerns!  


**Me:**

Hi \[...\], that’s not helpful at all. The Welcome Boosters don’t seem to exist.   


**WotC:**

**WotC:**

Unfortunately, we do not sell directly to consumers outside of [Secret Lair](https://secretlair.wizards.com/). In order to make a purchase or figure out what may be done to get these Welcome Boosters according to your nearby local game stores, we recommend visiting any of your local Wizards Play Network Stores as these are boosters tied very specifically to local WPN retailers and each is given a certain quantity to distribute usually when someone attends their in-person events and brings along someone who is completely new to Magic to join in, though each store may have slightly different circumstances under which they're willing to dish out those Welcome Boosters. If you can't find any local stores, we would recommend looking for an online vendor who may be able to help you.  
 

At this time Customer Support has no further details in regards to this topic.

10m6wwi,The Mirari and the Oil,True,"A common refrain is that the oil is doing too many new things too quickly - if a single drop could brainwash even the strong willed back in the original Invasion, there wouldn’t have been a war. Notably, it took Yawgmoth’s personal mindfuckery to get Gerrard, a Captain America level human, and Urza to snap and just for a brief amount of time. 

However, we HAVE seen an object with the ability to warp and twist even the strongest into desiring it at all costs - the Mirari. Which was last seen with Glissa, Slobad, and Geth. Of the three Glissa probably had it and we all know that Jimmy G found her. Given how little we actually know about the starts of new Phyrexia I imagine that the Mirari also played a role in just how fast this strain has spread and progressed. Its Karn-centered daddy issues may also explain Elesh Norm’s fixation on impressing Karn which has always stuck out as a weird leap of logic for her to take.

The other supporting evidence is we have seen Memnarch’s frame and head on Venser and Untet but these are just his shell so I can’t help but think Wizards is implying the mirari’s presence through its absence. 

TLDR: Jin has the Mirari, used it to upgrade the oil, explains New Phyrexia’s explosive success and new brainwashing abilities",14,0.67,18,magicTCG,2023-01-27,0,reddit

**Commonly Asked Questions**

* *I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?*

Don't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call ""The List"".

Here is the quote describing what factors describe a third space.

> Most modern places completely fail to meet even a few of the elements Oldenburg used to define the ideal third space:

>   Neutral Ground: The space is for anyone to come and go without affiliation with a religion, political party, or in-group.

>   Level Ground: Political and financial status doesn't matter there.

>   Conversation: The primary purpose of the location is to converse and be social.

>   Accessible: The third place is open and available to everyone and the place caters to the needs and desires of the community that frequents it.

>   Regulars: On a nightly or at least weekly basis the same cast of people rotate in and out, contributing to the sense of community.

>   Unassuming: Third places aren't regal or imposing. They're home-like and serve the function of a home away from home for the patrons.

>   Lack of Seriousness: Third places are a place to put aside person or political differences and participate in a community. Joking around and keeping the mood light is a big part of the ""public house"" experience.

>   Third Place as Home: A third place must take on multiple elements of the home experience including a feeling of belonging, safety, coziness, and a sense of shared ownership. A successful third place has visitors saying ""this is our space and I feel at home here.""

I bring this up because nothing else in my life really feels like it could be a third place to me. It makes me wonder if this aspect of being a LGS is what drew me to and kept me playing Magic over the years.

So, what do you guys think? Is your LGS a third space to you?",12,0.63,22,magicTCG,2023-01-08,0,reddit
105als6,Double sleeve ? The opening on the bottom is underrated.,True,"i used to double sleeve in the normal way (outer sleeve opening on the top, and a KMC perfect fit inside  in the opposite direction)

but when i grab my cards on the table i noticed that i almost always use my index fingernail ( despite being cut) to grab the card by the top. When i do this, i struggle to grab the cards because  my fingernail often catches the front of the sleeve but not the whole thing.

So i started to double sleeve reversed (outer sleeve opening on the bottom) and i noticed few improvements :

* I grab my cards way easier when they are in play on the table
* There is actually LESS dust in my sleeves (in normal double sleeve gravity seems to help dust fall inside the sleeve, while in reversed it helps keeping dust at the opening on the bottom)
* My cards doesn't fall of the sleeves ( as one might think ) i need to shake the whole thing like a crazy , and very strongly  to actually have the card slightly out of the sleeve.
* My sleeves are less damaged (when you resleeve your cards you can notices ugly creases at the opening. Well grab the cards like me, causes the same thing... but it doesn't whith the outer sleeve on upside down )",12,0.69,16,magicTCG,2023-01-07,0,reddit

I'm not sure what would happen if I were to make creature copies of equipment though.

Living weapon would trigger and create the Germ token, but would it work like reconfigure, where the equipment stops being a creature and still attaches to the Germ?
 Would I be able to equip anything else? 

Or would I just have an indestructible 1/1 token that doesn't have access to the equipment abilities?

10hl5a7,Burn & Turn & Burn - Turning the Kelermorph Competitive.,True,"Hi Everyone, 

I am trying to make a competitive deck with the new Warhammer commander Ghyrson Starn Kelermorph. I have seen videos of different variations on him but to me they seem slow and lackluster. 

I play in a group that is ruthlessly competitive and shows no mercy. We aren't at cEDH level, but we may be soon if someone messes around and buys a chrome mox. 

The point of this deck is to play a deck that isn't Niv where you die to people swinging at you to stop you getting off the one combo, rather, it is to burn down the house with cards that are synergistic and fast and speed. 

These are the main combos that I have thought about and put into the deck. I am thinking that I perhaps have too many tutors or too many counterspells to really start the fire. Perhaps you have suggestions about combos with spells not just creatures that I'm not aware of. 

Here is a link to the deck:

[https://www.moxfield.com/decks/5gObbCnP2UqwCfLDm-oBfA](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/5gObbCnP2UqwCfLDm-oBfA)

I have a maybe board where I'm not sure about. 

Below are some combos that I have thought about:

\-----

Zurzoth / Brallin / Glint-Horn / Niv Mizzet / Locus God work together nicely to discard to do 1 damage.

Ophidian Eye / Niv Mizzet / Tandem Lookout / Exalted Sorcerer / Curiosity / Rhystic Study / Fevered visions work together to give you card advantage (benefits locus god and Zurzoth)

Fevered Visions / Zurzoth give you free devils and also takes down your opponents life.

Goblin Sharpshooter / Razorfin Hunter / Basilisk Collar / sigil of sleep / Blasphemous Act to clear the board and let you begin (low CMC's let you restart easily).

Isochron Sceptre / Dramatic Reversal / Creature does damage from instants or sorcery or untaps to do damage = infinite combo

Niv Mizzet / Card Draw effect = Infinite Combo

Birgi / Mizzix of Izmagnus / Searing touch = infinite damage / mana combo / buyback.

Grafted Exoskeleton / Manabarbs while you tap your artifacts = GG.

\-------

Let me know what you think / if there is a more efficient / explosive ways of getting these combos out!

2. Do not spam this thread. Your sell/trade offer(s) should be confined to one post per week. If you list multiple cards as separate orders, or multiple lots of cards as separate orders, do so in the same post with a clear delineation. As a seller, you may post whether you want offers within the thread or whether you want a private message. If you want to make this different for different listings, that's your prerogative. State what country you're shipping from and include shipping price+method for your own country. If you are willing to ship to other countries, say so. 

3. **No eBay posts.**

4.  If a card is sold/traded, edit your post and invalidate any pending offers for that card. ""Short selling"" is not acceptable here, since we're dealing in physical goods and shipping times may be an issue, especially if the buyer is a tournament player. Do not short sell cards.

5.  Buyers: Post your offer directly underneath a sell listing, unless you are topping someone else's offer, in which case you should post directly underneath that offer.

6.  Buyers: Feel free to post a ""want"" list.

With that in mind, I can't imagine they will do away with the four main tribes, but instead expand on the world.  We know there are demons which we have only barely seen, as well as a Bat Vampire God that the vampires were looking for. We also have the fan-shipped Jace and Vraska, recently compleated, and maybe honeymooning there. I could see them doing a ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""  type of situation, where maybe there are new tribes (or some of the same tribes but with different colors) living in this underrealm. Maybe Jund Dinosaurs? Dimir Merfolk? 

I would hope that we get 4 Commander decks for this set representing the tribes we know and love from Ixalan. I could also see a return of some sort of ""Treasures"", or powerful artifacts and lands from magic's history but with a flavorful spin and a new border on them. We can likely also expect Battle cards, although we have no idea what they do yet.

I know that popularity and win rate don't always go hand in hand, but it seems like these decks can have both. 

Curious as to why people think that happens.

10hb4n8,What less known/obscure rules or interactions have you learned over time?,True,"There were two instances for me. 

One is how haste actually works. When I first brewed my Pingers deck years ago I thought I could start tapping them after my turn, not realizing that summoning sickness cares about if they have been on the field since the beginning of my last upkeep. Made me add more haste to that deck for sure. 

The second one was regarding priority. In the back of my mind I remembered hearing about this somewhere that active players always get a chance to use Planeswalker abilities when they enter before anyone can interact. And loyalty abilities are sorcery speed. But that didn't click as a whole rule with me yet. So when someone played a [[Sythis]] I wanted to kill it at instant speed before they got to get her cast trigger. Because Sythis. And that's when this rule finally cemented in my head. The Sythis player still had a chance to cast an enchantment at sorcery speed and get at least one trigger. Definitely still killed their commander afterwards but that was definitely a learning moment for me!

10gnah7,Theory on the last white mythic in ONE,True,"It's your boy Riptide, back with another theory.

Each color in the set currently has three mythics per, and with the blue one basically known to be the Ichormoon Gauntlet (we have art), that leaves the white mythic to be one of the last mythics we've yet to see.

I have almost 100% confidence it's a For Mirrodin! pushed equipment. 

What evidence do I have? Most of the rest of the set was leaked yesterday, and the only white For Mirrodin! cards are two uncommons and a common.

Isn't that curious? Red and blue get rares, but what about white, THE equipment color?

I'm certain they wouldn't leave the color best known for equipment hanging.

It being a mythic, there's a couple routes they can go down:

A white version of a beloved Living Weapon, be it Batterskull or Nettlecyst. Tweaked for standard and pioneer obviously.

A NEW reclaimed by the resistance KALDRA, reborn in hexgold. I could definitely see this being the case, as Kaldra is often what people think of as *the* equipment that represents Mirrodin (not the Phyrexians).

Something totally new (an interesting route, but less of a straight up nod).

107jecj,Evolving Wilds,True,"As a new player again (and wasn't very good of a player many years ago), there are certain cards I don't understand the ""greatness"" of. One specifically is Evolving Wilds. I see it a lot in mono and dual colored decks. I play only pauper, so maybe it's less common in other formats.

To me, in a mono colored deck it is useless. It takes place of a land that you could use right away. You have to play the Evolving Wilds as your land drop, then the card you seek is put into play tapped. You spent two card slots for one card. Wouldn't you have just as good of a chance of getting a basic land by just replacing it with a basic land? Basically, it searches for something that could take its place to begin with.

For 2 colored decks, why not use one of the dual lands (the ""enters play tapped, add X or Y mana"" cards), since it takes up one deck slot, is tapped anyway, and gives you a selection of mana you need anyhow?

Perhaps I'm overthinking it, perhaps I'm completely missing something. I just see the card fairly frequently and it's spoken highly of, but I'm ignorant to its usefulness. Can anyone tell me I'm right, wrong, or in between, and how so?",11,0.65,64,magicTCG,2023-01-09,0,reddit

10l5311,Updating my 5 color Battlecruiser Reanimator and need help - What's new in the last few years?,True,"https://imgur.com/MGPqKnG

Hey all,

I have a [[Reaper King]] reanimator deck, it's not scarecrows at all! Instead, it's play scary monsters that reanimate other scary monsters. It's also almost completely altered if you want to see one, comment a name and if it's altered i'll post it :)

I have been pretty out of touch the last couple years, so suggestions for newer cards would be most helpful!

My Moxfield is a liiiiitle out of date by 7ish cards:
https://www.moxfield.com/decks/Xle6rt6p1kK1Bbihm4Puig

This is pretty casual. I don't play counterspells, i play some removal but nothing efficient, i don't play tutors, i don't play a slew of fast mana, i don't have infinite combos, and i don't even have a single basic land!

Almost all of my removal and reanimate is stapled onto bodies and not cheaply costed, but it's not one-shot effects that go away. I don't even have the literal namesake [[Reanimate]]. Since i reanimate and reuse, my removal creatures sometimes do double duty. Just so satisfying to bring back my dead who eat enemy creatures.

Winning involves value grinding ramp, draw, reanimate, attack. Sometimes i get a lethal board state from a mass reanimate spell. [[Flayer of the Hatebound]] and [[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord]] give me a lot of reach as well.

Some specific things i would like your help with to work on after not being able to keep up with new sets:

1. Splashy recurring reanimate effects.
2. Creatures that can remove permanents. I think i do not have enough. Particularly, the best kinds would be evoke, echo, or sacrifice so they can easier be reused. But, i did check out the new evoke
3. Sacrifice outlets that are easy to use and have a useful function for me. By easy to use, i mean i shouldn't have to spend too much mana each time to use it, and it should be a permanent. Some effects that would be good would sacrifice to reanimate (or to return graveyard card to hand), sacrifice to destroy permanents, sacrifice to draw/loot cards, etc.
4. Maybe a couple strong token generators? It gives me another angle of attack, and angle for defense. Gonna put [[Tombstone Stairwell]] in probably.

Here are some cards i found already so far, to give you an idea what i like and to eliminate some guesswork:

1. [[Gisa, Glorious Resurrector]] - this is exactly the kind of thing i'm going for.
2. [[Drana, the Last Bloodchief]] and [[Olivia, Crimson Bride]] - both have sort of restrictive drawbacks and both must attack, but otherwise repeatable.
3. [[Deathbringer Liege]] - i cast plenty of black spells, but not many white. Kind of middling.
4. [[Tetzimoc]] - I like that it's so hard to stop the prey counters, but then even if Tetzimoc gets countered and reanimated it still works.
5. [[Geralf, Visionary Stitcher]] - For very cheap you get value off a creature dying anyway, plus you can cycle to graveyard to rebuy effects.
6. [[Ghoulcaller Gisa]] - i like this for the same as Geralf, but the extreme amount of tokens draws me in.
7. [[Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath]] - It's ramp-draw-body in the graveyard, it returns itself. Sweet.
8. [[GrimGrin]] - It's okay as a sac outlet and it also destroys dudes, nice
9. [[Eerie Ultimatum]] - for a one-shot spell, i think this is flexible and big enough to consider.
10. [[Nethroi]] - I don't have mutate cards but this is 7 mana for a flexible reanimate etb creature, really cool but possibly not very worthwhile.
11. [[Chainer, Nightmare Adept]] - 4 is kind of cheap for his effect, although i don't know how many effects i want that require me to pay full cost for the creatures in my graveyard.
12. [[Hell's Caretaker]] - Swap ETB effects maybe.
13. [[Grave Titan]] - slow growing army card.",9,0.75,7,magicTCG,2023-01-25,0,reddit
10kbbae,"How did Nahiri, Jace, and Vraska get Compleated?",True,"So something that's been bugging me: how did these planeswalkers get compleated?

We're told that, historically, planeswalkers can't be Compleated because of their sparks. To get around that, Jin-Gitaxias goes to Kamigawa to do research on the Kami. Then he captures Tamiyo and compleats her using some new process that Tezzeret helped with. Ajani later gets captured offstage and compleated. With Tamiyo, at least, the compleation is done in a lab with a bunch of machines, possibly including the Reality Chip. Ajani gets compleated offscreen at some point, but that could similarly be a lab process. We see the same thing on a lesser scale with Rhona and her group: even with contact with the Phyrexians and with Phyrexian tech, they mostly aren't compleated. Rhona has a phyrexian eye and leg, but is otherwise human. There's some big lab setup where they're compleating people, which is shown as some in depth process involving big machines and surgery to swap out organic parts for mechanical ones. They don't just sprinkle on a bit of Glistening Oil and let that do its thing.

When we get back to Phyrexia, though, planeswalkers are getting compleated left and right just by getting splashed with a bit of the glistening oil. No need for the reality chip, no trip to the lab, just touch the oil and now you're magically turning into a machine. Vraska has a good cry after fighting in the arena and poof, now she's got a phyrexian scorpion tail. No need for surgery, it just grew there on its own.

Shouldn't they be immune to that? Maybe Lukka gets around it by fusing himself with a Phyrexian, and maybe Nissa gets sent to the lab for a quick wardrobe/internal organ change between scenes, but it seems like Nahiri, Jace, and Vraska weren't exposed to anything new, and should've been protected by the same planeswalker resistances they always had. Is this ever explained? Did Jin-Gitaxias somehow modify all of the glistening oil, everywhere, to be capable of compleating Planeswalkers and magically transforming their organic bits into mechanical ones, or is this just a plot hole?",11,0.63,36,magicTCG,2023-01-24,0,reddit

We already have Vraska on monoB, Jace will no doubt be monoU, Nissa is a likely candidate for monoG, no idea for monoR but for monoW I honestly would find it interesting if Elspeth filled the spot and did so willingly in order to stop the Phyrexian threat (by becoming one). 

This could go many ways, and I admit I might be behind on the lore here, but having an isolationist Phyrexia with free-willed Phyrexians would be interesting. Plus, the prospect of say Phyrexians coming to aid the universe in the next Eldrazi invasion or whatever multiverse threat is next, is quite a fun one for me personally.",9,0.66,16,magicTCG,2023-01-16,0,reddit
10c4pr5,Add some Chaos to your games!,True,"Inspired by this article: [https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/truly-chaotic-2014-04-22](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/truly-chaotic-2014-04-22)

I created a spreadsheet app version that you can use to select random chaos effects to liven up your games! Tried it out today and it was a load of fun. Smash the big red button to roll the main Chaos list, use the 'Enchant' button to choose a semi-permanent enchantment effect for the game. Rules and tips in tab 3.

You'll need to duplicate the sheet to make edits. Scripts are in Sheet 4 if you're curious - I was surprised how easy it is to make a dumb app in Sheets. Tab 1 is for Battlebox games (no land effects) or tutoring). Tab 2 for any old game.

Hope you enjoy, would love to hear your thoughts!

10bna3r,Commander Exercise 74 – A Scrying Approach,True,"Welcome back to Commander Exercise, the series where I build EDH decks for fun and to improve my deck building skills.

This time I got asked by Jettas\_Mtg on Instagram to build a deck with Elminster as a Commander.

Elminster has always been one of my favorite characters of the Forgotten Realms and I was a bit disappointed that he wasn’t in the original standard set dedicated to it! Luckily Commander Legends: Baldur’s Gate gave us the Sage of Shadowdale and, to us Commander players, to build a deck with him at the helm.

10blvbx,Daily Questions Thread - Ask All Your Magic Related Questions Here!,True,"This is a place for asking simple questions that might not deserve their own thread. For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.

We encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.

**Rules Questions**

Rules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).

**Deckbuilding Questions**

If you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.

Additionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as ""what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?"", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.

**Commonly Asked Questions**

* *I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?*

Don't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call ""The List"".

You can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website. For example, the contents of The List for Streets of New Capenna boosters can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14).",9,0.85,108,magicTCG,2023-01-14,0,reddit

I also just started a Twitter and you can follow me [@Prid3MTG](https://twitter.com/Prid3MTG) to get updates on when I make new posts and for various MTG Finance content and musings.

[Cityscape Leveler](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/452750/magic-the-brothers-war-cityscape-leveler?Language=English) is evaporating from the market and screams ""significantly underpriced"" to me given how quickly the remaining stock is selling. The card is seeing play in Standard (Izzet Ramp decks), Pioneer (SB of Monogreen) and even Modern (replacing Ugin in Tron). It's likely also popular in casual + EDH, possibly Cube as well, which helps to explain this sudden surge in popularity. [EAFs](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/453124/magic-the-brothers-war-cityscape-leveler-extended-art?Language=English&Printing=Foil&page=1) recently exploded from 15 to 40 almost overnight so it's clearly one of the hottest Mythics in BRO that flew under everyone's radar (myself included) for a bit too long.

[Unlimited Llanowar Elves](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/9125/magic-unlimited-edition-llanowar-elves?Language=English) /u/llanowarelvesftw is still [doing their thing](https://old.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/zwl66g/llanowar_elves_unlimited_buyout/) and I highly recommend listing any copies that you own because they just did another big round of buys for silly prices.

[Klauth's Will](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/243788/magic-commander-adventures-in-the-forgotten-realms-klauths-will?Language=English) never struck me as anything special but it's selling though 20-25% of its remaining supply every month which tells me that EDH players do value its power and flexibility when you're getting both halves of it. There's still a decent amount of supply left but if it keeps draining like this it could easily be a $5-10 card in the foreseeable future. My advice for something like this is to buy a small brick and ideally list it on TCG Direct for ~10 bucks and wait for the price to come to you rather than flip for a meager profit.

On the topic of Gruul cards cards that are selling well it has to be said that [Shadow in the Warp](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/285940/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-shadow-in-the-warp?Language=English) is a revenue behemoth and has basically been the best selling card from the set since it was released. Even compared to the #2 card [[Biotransference]] it's not particularly close to being close as the latter still has deep bricks available for purchase whereas Shadow has mostly sold through them. I really don't know when the best time to buy these will be but I do know that if you were going to keep tabs on a card from this set for pure organic growth and demand it's the undisputed king. I like the [Surge Foils](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/285941/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-shadow-in-the-warp-surge-foil?Language=English) as long term holds, ~30 looks like it will be the floor as a buy-in, but I'd be lying if I said that they're selling nearly as well as regular copies which are functionally flying off the shelf at ~15.

[7ED Caltrops](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/2844/magic-7th-edition-caltrops?Language=English) is basically bought out due to being an auto-include in [Ghyrson Starn, Kelermorph](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/285867/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-ghyrson-starn-kelermorph-surge-foil?Language=English) and I think the Foils are very obvious buys given the low supply and fact that 7ED foils are already a high value collector's item. Regular copies are fine too but foils have more meat on the bone IMO. I'm also very high on Ghyrson Starn, Kelermorph Surge Foils as long term holds because he's proving to be extremely popular and powerful in every branch of EDH and is doing very well on sites like CK, SCG, Hareruya, etc.

[Benevolent Hydra](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/455349/magic-jumpstart-2022-benevolent-hydra?Language=English) sold through a good chunk of its remaining supply today and is down to 6 ""real"" listings on TCG. The card is fantastic in ""Hardened Scales"" decks (even at X=0) and the fact that it scales better into the lategame than many alternatives has made it a hit with the casuals.  In EDH you play all of them regardless and it certainly makes the cut so it's probably heading to 17-20 range like [Rodolf](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/454908/magic-jumpstart-2022-rodolf-duskbringer?Language=English) and [Preston](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/454883/magic-jumpstart-2022-preston-the-vanisher?Language=English) due to this massive casual demand for a relatively broad and popular archetype.

Speaking of which [Branching Evolution](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/216588/magic-jumpstart-branching-evolution?Language=English) is also on a big uptick and looks like a decent buy if you want one for casual or EDH. It's been climbing since the Tyranid deck was released and pairs well with the aforementioned Hydra so both cards are showing very strong signs of growth.

[[The Reality Chip]] has sold through a huge portion of its supply since last month (440 vendors then to 240 today) and while I've commonly seen it included in Modern Hammer Time as a 1-of value engine I'm struggling to explain this obscene decline in supply. Hammer Time is unquestionably a tier 1 deck and the card is very good in it but... as a 1-of. I'm guessing that there's some sort of influencer bump occurring here because nothing else really makes sense to me given that it doesn't appear to have significant EDH penetration as a generic value spell. I'd keep on eye on it for now because supply is very deep (also the Japanese alt art is dope!) so I'd wait to see if the price keeps trickling up.

I know that I've talked about the [Legacy Initiative](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/272541/magic-commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate-white-plume-adventurer?Language=English) deck a fair amount already but it turns out every 4-of in that deck is moving and [[Emeria's Call]] is no exception. It's better enough than a Plains to earn slots even in Legacy and given that you'll always play these kinds of lands EDH is the demand profile is relatively robust. What I like most about DFC specs (like [[Esika, God of the Tree]]) is that they're extremely resilient to reprints (we've literally never seen them in The List, Commander decks, Standard sets, etc.) making it significantly less likely that you'll get burned or caught holding the bag.

[[Drannith Magistrate]] is either going to eat a ban or forever be relevant in EDH but unless the former comes to fruition it's probably always going to be a force on buylists and TCG Direct alike. ""You can't cast your Commanders"" isn't the most fun line of text ever written, especially since it has a plethora of other Staxy uses as well, but you can't argue with its efficacy so unless something changes we're looking at a de facto White staple in the same vein as an Eternal Witness.

[[Acererak the Archlich]] is popping off on Direct after getting the AspiringSpike treatment in Modern as it's a 3 card combo with [[Heartless Summoning]] and [[Relic of Legends]]. While the deck didn't strike me as anything special (I watched a few VODs) I'd definitely recommend listing any that you have to capitalize on those Direct premiums. Note that I see this as a flash-in-the-pan that will fade as quickly as it came to be so I wouldn't linger or go deep if you plan to action this. This is the time to be selling whatever you have left of these.

[[Shorikai, Genesis Engine]] has cemented itself as one of the most popular and arguably most powerful Azorius Commander ever printed and proving be to be a force in all things EDH. It's not only a grindy, resilient engine that doubles as a kill condition but it also provides support for a relatively overlooked and underutilized category of cards in vehicles. Almost more importantly it's a fun deck to pilot and play and can be as competitive or casual as you desire. For all these reasons and more we should fully expect it to continue to be a strong seller on places like Direct while having strong buylist backings from the CKs of the world.

With respect to Retro frame artifacts the MTG finance community warned people very early on that everything other than the cream of the crop would be massacred (you were guaranteed one in every BRO booster pack) and sure enough that's exactly what happened. What I will say is that new product doesn't seem to be entering the market nearly as quickly now that we're approaching DMR and most of the top playables have likely already found something very close to their floor. No crystal ball or promises but prices are already bouncing back to some extent. This includes [[Mox Amber]], [[Wurmcoil Engine]], [[Ashnod's Altar]], [[Helm of the Host]] and [[Aetherflux Reservoir]]. Not surprised to see that Mythics dominate the list but also not surprised to see Altar easily shrug off the extra supply from being a Rare.

[W40K Surge Foils](https://www.mtgstocks.com/interests) are popping off left and right and rather than list them all I'm just going to link Stocks and you can check out the foil movers. Tons of obvious manipulation going on but if it works it works. The only card that I found interesting was [Prairie Stream](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286557/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-prairie-stream-surge-foil?Language=English) because it's the only one that wasn't targeted/bought out and appears to be natural, organic drain. I expect to see a lot more of this for highly desirable EDH playables like [Sol Ring](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/285817/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-sol-ring-252-surge-foil?Language=English), [Farseek](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/285962/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-farseek-surge-foil?Language=English), [Talisman of Progress](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286580/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-talisman-of-progress-surge-foil?Language=English), [Endless Atlas](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286394/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-endless-atlas-surge-foil?Language=English) and [Worn Powerstone](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286130/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-worn-powerstone-surge-foil?Language=English) but also plenty more buyouts and manipulation. I've said it before and I'll say it again but I'm extremely high on sealed W40K CE decks as long term holds (even at current prices) as I don't see this trend of Surge Foil attacks/buyouts stopping anytime soon.

[SLD Karn, The Great Creator](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/247337/magic-secret-lair-drop-series-karn-the-great-creator?Language=English) has done nothing but climb since it was printed and while I don't know how anyone actions this now it does reinforce that when a SLD contains a 4-of, must have, multi-format staple the play is to max out and never look back. If you can find these cheap they look like good buys but realistically you probably won't. Again, this is more about the lesson than the spec.

Last week I mentioned how [Fury](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/240325/magic-modern-horizons-2-fury?Language=English) and some other free cards were moving and this week I'll do one of two things. First, I'll throw out that [Flawless Maneuver](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/212150/magic-commander-2020-flawless-maneuver?Language=English) is also starting to move and has sold through 30% of its supply since last month. Secondly, and I cannot stress this enough, but [[Fury]] is one of the absolute hottest cards on the market and has gone though roughly 50% of its supply since last month with 30% of that occurring in the last week. You can say/think whatever you want about the current price not leaving enough meat on the bone but I (personally) vehemently disagree and think that it's an easy buy especially if you need some to play with.",242,0.97,59,mtgfinance,2023-01-03,0,reddit

10bl6vb,cardkingdom selling at different grades than buying,True,"Has anyone else notice cardkingdom often sells cards at a different grade than they bought it from you?

Also I do want to say this is just like a heads up discussion post, it isn't like me wanting to find a way to get more money from cardkingdom, I agreed to the g grade because I thought they were being really critical on the grading because of the price of the card and also thought if I sent it somewhere else they would do the same thing and I'd risk selling it for less.

10dnnw3,Speculation on WotC's monetization strategy after the death of Standard,True,"Standard has until very recently been one of the main driving forces of sales of new sets, at least among enfranchised players. Since sets rotate out, WotC could focus on making fun and engaging draft/Standard environments and sell new sets based on that instead of relying on powercreep. 

I don't think anyone would disagree that paper Standard is in decline. Between Arena, mismanagement of the pro scene, COVID, and the rise of EDH, in-store Standard play has dropped off significantly. I'm even noticing less drafts firing too, possibly as a consequence of EDH taking over casual play.

Post-WAR we've seen a sharp rise in power creep with the introduction of FIRE design, both in Standard sets and supplementary sets. My concern is that with this new design philosophy, coupled with the absence of Standard, the current problems with power creep will only continue to get worse, and I think that represents a much greater threat to Magic both as a game and as an investment than any other issue people bring up. If WotC can't sell sets off their appeal to Standard and draft, they have to resort to other monetization strategies.

For a cautionary example of what a monetization strategy based on power creep might look like, we can look to Yugioh. Unlike Magic, Yugioh doesn't have set rotation. The way they sell new sets is by printing new, more powerful archetypes and staples while simultaneously crippling existing decks with bans, essentially rotating the format without actually taking sets out. Magic players complain when a particular deck has a 15%+ meta share, but it's not uncommon to see a deck reach 50%+ representation in Yugioh tournaments. The end result of that is power creep so severe that the Yugioh of today is basically unrecognizable next to the Yugioh of 5 or 10 years ago.

Granted, printing pushed new Mythics isn't the only way to sell a new set. WotC can and has also tried mining reprint equity and creating super-chase rare versions of cards. The problem is that these solutions are not sustainable in the long-term. Reprint equity is finite and you can only sell so many ""special"" prints of cards before players stop caring.

So what do you think the future of Magic will look like? Will WotC's current practices turn Magic into another Yugioh? Can WotC sustainably monetize the game without Standard and draft? Do you think this all overblown and Magic will continue doing fine without sacrificing its identity and gameplay? I'm interested in hearing people's thoughts and how any of this influences your choice of specs, if it does at all.",158,0.89,205,mtgfinance,2023-01-16,0,reddit

105poop,"Market Movements 01/07/23 - Virtue's Ruin, Loyal Apprentice, Breena, the Demagogue, Reanimate, SLD Inkmoth Nexus, Thassa's Oracle, Grand Abolisher, Kindred Dominance, Ancient Tomb",True,"\[\[Ground Rift\]\] sold many hundreds of copies yesterday off the back of potential combo applications with the newly leaked Venerated Rotpriest in Modern. I don't expect to see much movement until people like Mengu and Spike weigh in on its viability but it's a good card to keep your eye on.

\[\[Virtue's Ruin|POR\]\] was a card that had 188 listings on TCG a month ago and is down to 67 today representing a \~60% decrease in supply month over month. Pretty amazing for a Portal uncommon. I'm told this is due to increased sideboard play in Legacy in order to combat the Initiative menace and that seems to line up with when the card first started moving. I find these specs hard to action beyond doing something like buying CSI's NM brick at a buck a copy, putting it on a Direct for an inflated price and seeing what happens.

\[\[Loyal Apprentice\]\] is a quietly powerful EDH card that sees play in a plethora of Winota-like shells that want lots of cheap bodies/tokens/artifacts and has sold through around 40% of its total supply since last month. This is another card that I'd be looking to snag a brick of and pop it on Direct because odds are you could get well above market price for it. The big scare here is that it's perfect for the new Boros precon which means it could easily be included in the deck. I would sit on this for now but once we see the decklist it's an easy buy if it's excluded.

\[\[Mawloc\]\] has sold through roughly 80% of its supply on TCG since last month, most of which was a ""buyout"" of sorts that occurred a few days ago. This card is anticipated to be a staple in GSZ decks in Legacy while also being a new Cube staple so I'm not surprised that someone moved on it. I'll be talking about prime W40K specs in an upcoming 'article"" once we know the release day for the set on MTGO so I'll leave it at that for now.

\[\[Talisman of Progress|40K\]\] Surge Foils are \~4.50 on TCG and CK is buying 12 at 7 cash // 9 credit and I expect that number to be increasing soon. When they sell out of a card they often bump both the retail price and the buylist %. Not a ton of meat on the bone buy buying at \~4 cash and getting \~10 credit once those numbers trend a little lower + higher should be a reasonable play. I expect something similar to happen with \[\[Herald's Horn|40K\]\] Surge Foils in the near future too given that it's the only foil version of a popular tribal card so CK can sell them way faster and easier than anyone else. It's not free money today whereas Progress is but I'd be keeping a close eye on its CK buylist.

\[\[Breena, the Demagogue|C21-328\]\] nonfoil extended arts are doing great on TCG/buylists/Direct/etc. off of what can only be significant EDH demand for a Tymna-like threat. Bluntly put I never thought anything of this card when I saw it because who cares about a worse Tymna with no Partner? Well, lots of people apparently! Maybe I shouldn't be that surprised given the rise of creatures like Esper Sentinel, Dauthi Voidwalker, Archivist of Oghma, Opposition Agent, Grim Hireline and more in EDH. The real play here is to get NM copies on Direct and fight for that \~$20.00 sale price and I wouldn't really bother unless you can.

Basically all nonfoil versions of \[\[Reanimate\]\] are performing well on TCG and buylists with the OG Tempest being especially lucrative on Direct. I assume this is mostly because of the Entomb reprint in DMR making people hyped to bling out Reanimator but who knows. I tend to ignore these specs because the \~5 versions means none of them will experience explosive gains but what it does tell me is that if you want some to play with I wouldn't sit around on it.

There's a few secret lair cards doing very well and by that I mean they're selling through significant portions of their supply every month, they move well on TCG Direct and they have strong CK buylist backing (55%+ of their retail value) that is consistently increasing over time. For anyone unaware CK offers between 0% and \~65% of their retail value on cards and anything in the 55%-65% range means they're probably churning it like butter. The big 4 movers of this month are \[\[Inkmoth Nexus|SLD\]\], \[\[Kodama's Reach|SLD\]\], \[\[Generous Gift|SLD\]\] and \[\[Wrath of God|SLD\]\] which are all showing strong signs of growth in all 3 categories. WoG is a bit iffy with DMR dropping in a week (it's in the set) so I'd pass on that one for now but the others are worth taking a gander at. No surprises here since they're mostly EDH staples and pet lovers are a special breed (no pun intended) and Inky is clearly because of Toxic being a marquee mechanic in ONE.

\[\[Thassa's Oracle\]\], much like Breach, is a multiformat allstar and premier kill condition with things like Inverter of Truth, Grinding Station, Doomsday, Demonic Consultation/Tainted Pact, Thought Lash, etc. The price certainly reflects that! As you can probably imagine this card churns well, has great buylist backing, the buylists are constantly increasing, the Extended Art Foils go for obscene amounts, it moves well on Direct, it's basically a free money card until it gets reprinted. Even then it will still be a free money card just at a new price point. The real scare IMO is that it eats a ban in a format but outside of EDH I don't see that happening in Modern/Legacy just yet so you're probably good to exploit this one for a little while longer at the very least.

\[\[Counterbalance\]\] is still red hot from what I'm told is significantly increased Legacy play and the single print + low supply are really catching up with it. I don't own any so I'm not repeating this one to drum up hype but from what I'm seeing we're going to wake up one day very soon and ask ""why was CB bought out?"" when the reality was it's just consistently selling as a 4-of to players and has no supply. This is a must watch and must buy if you can get copies on Direct.

\[\[Grand Abolisher\]\] speaking of low print cards that are selling out and that have insane TCG Direct premiums, this EDH/cEDH staple is up to 50 on Direct for NM copies. No reprint in 8 years is taking its toll on supply, especially since it's still one of the go-to forms of combo/Voltron protection in White. No interaction leaves you free to load your Commander up with Equipment or combo off unimpeded and the 2 CMC means it comes down quicker and easier than Myriel.

\[\[Kindred Dominance\]\] is another card showing strong signs of growth which makes sense given that we got back-to-back Rat lords, it only has 1 printing and it was already a staple in every Black tribal EDH deck. Zombies, Vampires, Rats, everything plays it. It's selling through reasonable portions of its remaining supply every month, it has strong buylist backing, it's doing well on Direct, the buylists are increasing, it's doing everting that I want to see in a spec. As always a big reprint would dampen growth but unless it shows up in The List in ONE or whatever it should keep posting strong numbers across the board.

\[\[Loran of the Third Path\]\] Extended Art Foils were bought out in a targeted attack against them and the regular Extended Arts followed shortly after. The card is seeing play in every competitive format and is great in all of the ""casual"" ones too (Cube, EDH, cEDH). EAFs are relatively scarce in BRO CBBs since they share a slot with Foil Retro Artifacts so it makes sense why they did it. We've previously seen \[\[Cityscape Leveler\]\] EAFs bought out the week prior and it wouldn't surprise me if this trend continued for other EAFs that see significant play from BRO.

\[\[Ancient Tomb|TMP\]\], much like Reanimate, is a card where basically every version is trending in the right direction due to being a staple in Cube, EDH, cEDH and Legacy as a 4-of in decks like Wx Initiative and Moon Stompy. The Tempest version in particular has sold through 50% of its supply in the last month 35% of which was in the last week. It has a crazy Direct premium for NM copies and looks like a fantastic card to snag from the EU or any place where you can find reasonably priced copies.",135,0.94,17,mtgfinance,2023-01-07,0,reddit

10crmrg,"NEO Might Be the Only Set in 1 Year with EV Close to """"MSRP""""",True,"So yes, MSRP no longer exists in a literal sense. That being said, there is generally a Standard Price Range you see for sets around release. 

It's ~$100 for a Draft Booster Box of a Normal Priced Set 

It's ~$200 for a 1st Tier Premium Set

It's ~$300 - $400 for a 2nd Tier Premium Set like Double Masters. 

Looking at the EVs (by TCGPlayer Market) of Draft Boxes released since NEO though:

**NEO: $88.96** (~$11 Delta with Initial Price)

**SNC: $66.30** (Lower than Midnight Hunt, ~$34 Delta)


**Commander Legends: Baludur's Gate** I couldn't find good information on the EV of a Box but... Draft Boxes are down to $75... for a premium set... so yeah... I feel like it's well known the numbers are really really bad. 

**2X2: $212.40** ($300 for a ""good"" early price, $400 peak, $88 to $188 Delta)

**DMU: $67.51** (Higher Cost Basis starting with this set from Hasbro Distributor price increase, also lower value than Midnight Hunt, $33 Delta)

**Unfinity** I also had trouble with finding a Box EV of, but the 3 most valuable normal printings in the set are: [[Saw in Half]] at $6.98, [[Comet, Stellar Pup]] at  $6.53, and [[Clown Car]] at $1.74. Additionally many stores don't buy-list Acorn cards, so I feel comfortable asserting this EV was not just bad, but possibly the lowest of any set in recent memory. 

**BRO: $76.95** (This set is still new and EV hasn't bottomed out yet. Still ~$25 Delta)

**DMR: TBD** (Assuming BRO keeps falling, this is the last chance for a set to not have a 25+% EV Gap in the year since NEO.)


And that, is not great. Particularly given that DMU had a price increase in Distributor costs. Either players or sellers are taking a beating here pretty much every set. Because there's not enough EV to justify much, if any, margin on Boxes. 

2021 was also rough, with Kaldheim being the only standard set with EV over $80, and Double Feature... being a thing that happened. But at least there was MH2 which did really well. 

I'd be interested to hear what other think about this. 


**TL;DR: Look at the Bolded EVs. NEO EV good, everything else looking weak. If DMR EV low, that's a year of poor EV sets. Seems bad?**",131,0.9,84,mtgfinance,2023-01-15,0,reddit
10cvw4m,"Market Movements 01/15/23 - Laelia, the Blade Reforged, Da Vulcha, Creative technique, Stormsurge Kraken, Mantle of the Ancients, Venser's Journal",True,"[Da Vulcha](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/450602?Language=English&Printing=Normal) has sold through 65% of its TCG supply since last week from what I'm guessing is a combination of generic Warhammer demand and Gruul Vehicles being a top tier Pioneer deck. The card also sees a decent amount of Pioneer SB action and it's probably fine in EDH but either way the card is going to quickly climb from 10 to 15, possibly even 20 from here since all of the cheap copies have more-or-less been grabbed already. I'll note that many of the Ork cards are seeing extremely strong signs on growth and so I highly recommend keeping tabs on the [Ork drop itself](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/450526/magic-secret-lair-drop-series-secret-lair-x-warhammer-40000-orks?Language=English) because I expect it to be a steady long-term gainer if current trends maintain themselves.

Speaking of Secret Lairs a whole slew of them are kinda popping off this week including [Jet Medallion](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/450600?Language=English&Printing=Normal) and [Ghazghkull, Prophet of the Waaagh!](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/450601?Language=English&Printing=Normal) which have sold through 38% and 35% of their supply respectively. Medallion makes total sense since it's an EDH staple that hasn't been reprinted in what feels like forever and while I don't think Zurgo is quite the beast he once was this reads more like Warhammer fans rallying behind a beloved character and faction.

[City of Traitors](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/4303/magic-exodus-city-of-traitors?Language=English) has sold through 50% of its supply since last month (25% of which was in the last week) due to massively increased popularity in both Legacy and Vintage in the Monowhite Initiative deck. It's a must have 4-of, it's Reserved List, it's great in other decks (think Moon Prison and such), the card is looking fantastic in terms of growth especially if paper Legacy events come back in any meaningful capacity. Definitely a card you want to be keeping close tabs on because RL always opens the door for explosive gains that take a significant amount of time to retrace.

[Creative Technique](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/236369/magic-commander-2021-creative-technique?Language=English), [Apex Devastator](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/226872/magic-commander-legends-apex-devastator?Language=English) and Surge Foil [Let the Galaxy Burn](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286034/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-let-the-galaxy-burn-surge-foil?Language=English) have all sold through roughly 30% of their supply in the past month due to a [new deck](https://mtgdecks.net/Legacy/creative-tecnique-decklist-by-andrea-mengucci-1536427) that's somewhat popping off in Legacy. The idea here is that you cast a Technique, hit only Cascade spells that Cascade into more Techniques which inevitably leads to assembling a gigantic board of awesome fatties (ideally with Emrakul to instantly seal the deal). No idea how viable the deck is or anything but a good chunk of the deck is moving so I wanted to call everything out together.

[Stormsurge Kraken](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/94195/magic-commander-2014-stormsurge-kraken?Language=English) is absolutely chewing through its supply and current has an obscene Direct premium of over 2x TCG low. No idea if it's a content creator bump or generic EDH demand for KLOS tribal but the card is popping off hard enough and suddenly enough that I feel like there has to be a video circulating somewhere about it. At 5 mana it always seemed too expensive to ever be considered a staple (IMO) which is another reason why I feel like there's probably more to this than organic demand.

In a similar vein [Mantle of the Ancients](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/243752/magic-commander-adventures-in-the-forgotten-realms-mantle-of-the-ancients?Language=English) is also doing very well on Direct and has sold through roughly 27% of its supply since last week. The trick might be to list LP copies since NMs are probably always running out and the LPs are moving for 7. One of my go-to rules of thumb is that if I ever see the LastSavePoint actually selling cards you know there's an opportunity to exploit. Anyway, this seems like generic EDH demand for Light-Paws, Bruna, Rafiq and any other Enchantment-based Voltron commander coupled with being a single print card from a Commander set.

Let's keep the ""great Direct plays"" going with [Venser's Journal](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/236671/magic-commander-2021-vensers-journal?Language=English) due to being an extremely popular casual/EDH card and has basically no demand in the EU. It has 3 versions or whatever but they're all looking pretty great as they're doing a good job of churning through 18-22% of their supply every month while constantly climbing on buylists and Direct.

Moving away from Direct another thing that I like to do is track CK buylists for cards and flag ones that are showing significant gains in relatively short periods of time because it signals to me that there's immense organic demand for these cards that the market may not be aware of. Two that are currently jumping off the page are [Borderless Tasha, the Witch Queen](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/272658/magic-commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate-tasha-the-witch-queen-borderless?Language=English) and especially [Laelia, the Blade Reforged](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/273696/magic-commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate-laelia-the-blade-reforged?Language=English) which have both essentially double since last month and are draining quickly from TCG as well. Tasha I could take or leave, this reads like generic EDH demand to me, but Laelia strikes me as a very hot spec because not only is her buylist rapidly climbing but her supply is also dwindling when I look back 3 months. Almost 75% in total and almost all organic drain from people buying 4 or fewer copies. I know that Legacy Moon Prison plays 4 and she's probably a staple in [[Propser, Tome Bound]] but either way I'd be very happy to snag a small brick of these and jam them on Direct at an inflated price and see what happens in a month or two.",124,0.94,24,mtgfinance,2023-01-15,0,reddit

108b89k,"Market Movements 01/10/23 - Maskwood Nexus, Ratatcher, War Room, Spawning Kraken, Turntimber Sower, Shizo, Death's Storehouse, Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon",True,"\[\[Maskwood Nexus|CLB\]\] this consistently selling through good portions of its supply (down 40% from last month, 27% from last week) as its one of the few ways to enable various combos and ""tribal matters"" synergies. It also seems to have a decent amount of speculators rallying behind it as I see a significant number of sales for dozens of copies at a time. We call these ""anomalous sales"" which is a fancy way of saying speculative. That might seem bizarre because why would you buy into someone else's spec? but In practice I find that you can make a lot of money on specs where 15-20% of the TCG sales are anomalous (e.g. people buying significantly more than 4 copies at a time) because if 80% of the demand is ""real"" and the floor is being swept it benefits everyone. I'm not calling this exact spec an auto-win or anything, the market still does as it wants, but I figured it helps to add some additional context every now and then.

\[\[Ratcatcher|M25\]\] no shocker here but all versions of Ratcatcher are trending on buylists, Direct, etc. as a result of back-to-back Rat lords being printed in J22 and ONE. Multiple versions and decently deep supply doesn't leave a ton of meat on the bone (I mentioned this with \[\[Reanimate\]\] the other day and the same logic applies) but it's good to know that Rats are still selling.

\[\[War Room|CLB\]\] today is mostly a Commander day and it's tough to go wrong with anything with a low number of prints, that's colorless and that's good in EDH. Personally I think that most of these utility lands are overrated and unnecessary, I rarely find myself activating them, but luckily my vote doesn't count and the market speaks for itself. This is one where you really want to take advantage of Direct if possible because that's where you can buy a $2 card and immediately sell it for $7 and reinforces why it's so important for anyone in US MTGF to hit Direct as quickly as possible.

\[\[Spawning Kraken\]\] is unquestionably one of the best cards for the KLOS tribal decks and while it's mostly been flat the single print, low supply and strong casual demand is catching up to it. It's a card that sells as a 4-of way more than people probably think which suggests to me that there's plenty of casual players out there playing this in the ever popular ""cards I own"" format in addition to things like EDH. Again, it mostly speaks for itself since it only realistically works in one archetype but it does it very and that's allowing it to put up strong numbers across the board.

\[\[Turntimber Sower\]\] EDH has a lot of quiet movers that the market doesn't pick up on right away and the Sower here appears to be one them. I'm assuming it's played in a good chunk of Gitrog, Windgrace, Titania, etc. style landfall/land death decks because supply is way down, it moves well on Direct and buylists are creeping up. Definitely a good card to keep an eye on and one that most people are probably still unaware of. These are my (I think most people's) favorites kinds of specs because it's always fun to be one of the first ""in the know"" on a hot new card.

\[\[Aphetto Alchemist\]\] is a single print Onslaught Uncommon that combos with one of the newly leaked ONE Commanders (Unctus) to mill your library and Thoracle for the win. You turn it into an Artifact with Unctus, tap + untap itself to loot your entire library, assemble Thoracle + as much free permission as you can possible can and hopefully win from there. I don't expect Unctus to be an especially popular Commander but given that this is basically a 1-card combo, it's in 1 color and the card has no supply from an ancient set I could see this one popping off pretty hard on Direct at the very least.

\[\[Agadeem's Awakening\]\] I have to admit that I'm surprised to see this card do as well at it has because I would have bet the farm that it would have lost most of its value post-Standard rotation once the UB Rogues deck fell out of favor. It's actually been slowly creeping up, go figure. ZNR was opened to death so nothing drains quickly from that set but since we know DFCs are extremely difficult to reprint (you never see them in The List, Commander decks, etc) I could see this one being a slow, steady gainer for some time but I also struggle to see it experiencing any explosive gains unless it sees a big uptick in demand for a format like Legacy or Modern.

\[\[Shizo, Death's Storehouse|CLB\]\] is a great example of why tracking supply is routinely better than tracking market price because if you look at the TCG graph for this card it looks like it's heading to 0 but our nanomachines are basically screaming at us to buy them. The CK buylist for the original Champions version has basically doubled from 7.75 a month ago to 13 today which tells me that even though people are racing to the bottom to sell them because of the DMR reprint the market is running in even faster to buy them. I expect this one to do very well until it's inevitably reprinted again, including buylists and Direct.

\[\[Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon\]\] has been one of my favorite free money hacks from the EU since you could basically at any point bring them over for a 2:1 flip. Any version, foil or nonfoil, even the masters set reprint didn't matter because no one in the EU wanted them so you could pull over giant bricks for 3x flips a few months later on TCG. That aside this card back on the uptick now that we have another Poison set on the horizon with ONE. Not because it's a Modern playable or anything but Skittles has always done very well in NA with casual players.

\[\[Diabolic Tutor|SLD\]\] not the ""Diabolic"" tutor I was expecting to write about and while it has to be said that \[\[Diabolic Intent\]\] is a revenue behemoth the gargantuan supply of BRO has done a good job at keeping its price at the 6-7 range this entire time. Getting back to DT (no, not that DT) I don't really know much about this card and I guess it was some special limited Secret Lair Drop of some sort? Not sure. Either way it's selling through all of its copies and has basically no supply left. Buy in price is very high, buylist backing is mostly nonexistent and I have no idea who's buying these nor why. However, from a pure supply perspective this card is moving very quickly, especially given how niche and bizarre it seems.",114,0.95,67,mtgfinance,2023-01-10,0,reddit

10ko7nt,Full Analysis of Value Drivers in MTG pre-2002 (up to 7th edition): Lessons and Opportunities,True,"  

This is a follow up on a post I made a few months back, and likely the first in a short series of related posts. I'm traveling at the moment and won't always be answering comments in real time, but wanted to get this up while the numbers I pulled for the the data analysis were still correct!   I intend to do a follow up posts with additional analyses, graphs, etc. based on comments, questions, and requests.  

**Main Message: I can empirically show that the conventional wisdom on this thread regarding drivers of value in MTG cards holds true.**  **For the pool of all MTG cards up through 7th edition,**  i**t’s all about age and rarity, but within the cheaper (< $1000) stuff from that period, EDH clearly drives the market.** **Model suggests that in some cases assigned rarity leads to under or over valuing assets relative to set print run and total number of cards in a set, further the results suggest that there are other opportunities for acquiring undervalued assets for future profit.**  

***Below you can find musings, main results summary, information about the dataset used, and the analyses.*** 

&#x200B;

**Musings:** The biggest eye openers for me were that set print run on its own is misleading, you need to account for number of cards in a set and consider card print run.  This leads to the potential for underappreciated ""uncommon"" cards in the early expansion sets such as legends which are incredibly rare, rarer even than early years ""rares"" from other sets, i.e assigned rarity on its own is incredibly misleading but it drives prices.   There is some potential unrealized value of some of the 4BB and FBB cards which may yet spike in the American market.  Additionally some cards that aren't reserved list but haven't ever been reprinted such as camouflage and false orders may be undervalued since there are so few copies in existence (Example: should Unlimited False Orders, even though its a common, really be only $2 since there just aren't that many of them ever printed?), similarly some cards like the reserved list card raging river may be undervalued.  Additionally, its truly amazing just how much EDH drives card prices for this sector of the the game's history.  If popularity in EDH ever begins to wane, it could spell trouble for large swathes of this segment of the market.   Finally, itts also fun to build a data set like this, I learned a lot!  For example, who here was aware of a fun basic land misprint in FBB called ""Wald"" that is technically a forest but has the art of a plains?  I bought one immediately, I thought that was a sweet looking early years misprint to have and not too pricey. 

&#x200B;

**Main Results Summary**

I. For all \~7000 cards in the pool (save foils which were excluded), in order of importance, value is dictated by 1) Card Print Run Size, 2) Set Name, 3) Age of the Card, 4) Assigned Rarity (this is very interesting actually - see below), 5) Total copies of the card across all printings, 6) Prevalence in EDH Decks, 7) Reserve List Status, 8) Type of Card (basic land, enchantment, etc), 9) Number of Printings, 10) Total casting cost, and everything else just falls to the wayside.  This random forest model was fit to natural log transformed card value data and the R\^2 value of the model (% variation explained) was 93%.

II. For cards currently valued at < $1000 (excluding the really expensive stuff), the story changes a little bit. Here the order of importance is 1) Card Print Run Size, 2) Set Name, 3) EDH Ranking, 4) Total Copies across printings, 5) Age of the Card, 6) % EDH Decks, 7) Rarity, 8) Card Type, 9) Reserve List Status, 10) Total Casting Cost, 11) Number of Printings, 12) Colorless Casting Cost, 13) Which printing of the card it is (1st, 2nd, etc), and then the rest of the predictors mainly fall out.  This model was fit to raw value data and the R\^2 value was 74%.

**Methods:**

**Dataset:** The data were from every set including foreign black border that was printed up until 7th edition. Foils were excluded because foils don't occur in all sets and sales data on them is notoriously poor and volatile. Data were pulled from a variety of sources and some things were modeled as there is no available information out there. I started with scryfall data requests to pull down information including card name, set, edh rank, card type, assigned rarity, artist, language, value in USD, value in euros, casting cost.  From there I broke casting cost into multiple sub categories including total casting cost, #’s of X’s, colorless mana, # black mana, etc., etc.  I pulled in reserve list status, days since printed, set type (core vs expansion), border color, legality in old school, vintage, legacy, edh, whether the art/card was “canceled” or not (e.g. stone throwing devils).  Things I calculated/estimated included which printing (1st, second, etc), total number of printings.  For print runs for each card, I started with what is well accepted to be true (see earlier reddit posts on this sub - [https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/8d8fvb/the\_definitive\_guide\_to\_print\_runs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/8d8fvb/the_definitive_guide_to_print_runs/)) for the ABU, ATQ, LEG, DARK, etc. I also took note of speculative estimates for Revised, Fallen Empires, etc. but didn’t use those estimates. I then pulled available information on copies available for sale of rares of each set and correlated those with known print runs to see if the relationship could be estimated, good news, it can, quite well actually (R\^2 \~ 0.9). I then interpolated the print runs for the sets where we don’t have print run estimates and cross validated those numbers against the sets where we have unconfirmed guesses. From there I estimated things like total number of copies of a specific version of the card and all versions of the card. All told the dataset had 36 columns of data.  To estimate the actual value of each card in USD I started by taking USD values and imputing converted euro values. Then all NA’s, etc. were looked up manually from auction sales (necessary for canceled cards, rare alpha cards, etc). Then I cross referenced card values from various printings across sets to look for outliers that indicated incorrect data. So for example, if a foreign black border card came up as 3 cents when the revised version was $2 I knew we had a problem. In all cases “bad values” were replaced either by looking up values or in rare cases, applying a median multiplier to convert from “good values” of the same card from another set. I.E. The median multiplier from 4BB to 4th Edition could be used to estimate missing 4BB values.

**Analysis:**  
 I’m glossing over a ton here but in a nutshell, analysis happened in two phases, first a visual exploration of correlations to check the data further and better understand the relationships. Second, I applied a machine learning statistical analysis called Random Forest to the data to identify the relative importance of predictors, asses overall ability to predict card value, and ability to identify undervalued cards (investment opportunities). Because of the large value spread I natural log transformed the response data for the full value model but in the model focused on cards under $1000 I fit the model to raw untransformed data.  I also played with boosted regression trees, mixed effects models, and other subsets of the data but I’m not displaying those here, I don’t think they add anything substantive to the story.",75,0.9,45,mtgfinance,2023-01-25,0,reddit
10glr17,Stats - Phyrexia: All Will Be One,True,"&#x200B;

WotC published the [collectors information](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-phyrexia-all-will-be-one) the other day so I spent some time today having a go at working out what are the chances of pulling each one of the types of cards.

Feel free to download / edit / suggest / fix [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hEgqg68SG1c9zkyBAlRy67z3JKr7LzAWAkp_swePZ2o/edit#gid=16234038&range=A9). It has multiple tabs, with the calculations.

It's not going to be 100% perfect. I had to make some educated guesses. If you spot anything, please let me know and I'll correct it. I think the margin of error should be <5%.

Last time many people enquired about the 2:1 Rare:Mythic Rare ratio I have used. I strongly think it is correct. The reasoning is [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/zhqhnt/comment/izpwtk9/).

In summary,

* Mythic rares (Step-and-Compleat Foil) are the hardest to pull (there is only 1 slot on the collector packs, there are 28 of them, and this is a C/U/R/M slot).
* In Draft boosters, they say ""A Traditional Foil Borderless Mythic Rare Planeswalker can be found in <1% of boosters"". Indeed, it's \~0.06%
* There is a new type of booster and some cards are unique to it: the Compleat Edition Booster, which is found on the [Compleat Edition Bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Phyrexia-Exclusive-Accessories/dp/B0BJ7MPSWS) ($80).
* To get 1 of everything by yourself you are gonna have to spend $800 on 10x Compleat Edition bundles, almost $5k on 242x Collector packs, and maybe $1k on 230x Set packs.

Edit: Thank you for all your observations and constructive feedback. There are some excellent points about the methodology I used. Full disclosure: English is not my first language and maybe some of the terms I used were not the correct ones.

What I wanted to illustrate here on the ""Cost to get 1 of each"" column, was that if there are X number of cards of an specific type, how many boosters did you need to crack in order to get at least X cards of that type. This is assuming an (unrealistic) amount of luck that you don't get duplicates. This is the lowest number. A realistic number will be a lot higher because you will definitely get duplicates, as after the first pack, the probabilities change. If you are not seeking a copy but let's say a playset, the numbers start to even out, but I appreciate that the way I phrased it is misleading. Any feedback on how to improve the terminology would be appreciated. I have added [more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/10glr17/comment/j53jaba/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this comment below.

10e21hb,If you're worried about DMR retro foils... don't be,True,"There's been a few posts on here from people asking whether or not DMR retro foils will crash original old frame prices and out of curiosity I bought a copy of \[\[Body Snatcher\]\] to compare.

If it wasn't clear already, collectors don't care about reprints like these for the most part because they love older cards regardless. Unless WotC can reproduce those cards in \*exactly\* the same quality as the sets prior to 8th Edition with the same artwork and everything then there isn't a reason to worry. Not to mention the absolute rarity of Urza's foils compared to now, which will always guarantee a premium.

That being said, comparing the original foil from Urza's Destiny to the reprint quite frankly the reprint does not compare. For someone who just wants to play the game and have a fun draft experience then it's fine, but upon closer inspection there are some things to note:

Card stock - something which may depend on where it's printed but it feels much more flimsy like how I'd expect a proxy or counterfeit to handle

Print quality - there is a much higher gloss surface that I've noticed more in recent sets since Kaldheim which is fine on its own, however the DPI (print resolution) on the cards themselves are lower, meaning the ""rosettes"" appear to be larger resulting in a loss of some crispness and detail of the original art

Foiling - it's completely dull like some sort of cheap washed out treatment, but that's not a new issue and honestly I feel all foils printed since the M15 frame have been boring as they don't use the spot printing treatment like they used to (where only certain parts of the artwork had any foiling, not the entire card)

For most people this is probably minor nonsense, but mostly it's just food for thought. I enjoy my old school foils, the game holds a lot of nostalgia for me personally but for new people entering the game they may not hold the same opinion. In any case, I hope this post provided to be useful.

zzy322,"Market Movements 31/12/22 - Surge Foil Exotic Orchard, Counterbalance, Mindbreak Trap, Endurance, Fury, Deflecting Swat",True,"[Surge Foil Exotic Orchard](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/286007/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-exotic-orchard-surge-foil?Language=English) experienced a massive ""buyout""/attack the other day where something to to the tune of ~250 copies disappeared from TCG. The card is a ubiquitous EDH staple and the only other foil copies were $50 and $60 respectively so the fact that these are only $3-5 certainly has its appeal.

[[Counterbalance]] hasn't moved much since Top was banned in Legacy but given that it's sold through roughly 30% of its supply over the past month I'm led to believe that the card is picking up steam again in Delver/Control/Standstill shells. It still ""does the thing"" with Brainstorm/Ponder/etc. and the single print from TSP is really starting to catch up with it. Direct has less than 2 NM playsets listed so the premiums are starting to get rather lucrative and the foils are nice because even if its reprinted in The List we wouldn't be getting any more of those. Definitely a good card to watch.

Similarly, [[Mindbreak Trap]] is following the same trajectory although this one is likely more Vintage than Legacy where it's commonly included as a 4-of in all of the Bazaar decks. Free, ""colorless"" counterspells speak for themselves and once again the single print run (no The List, nothing) is taking its toll. As with CB I like foils from the EU because the premium is already about a 2:1 and a reprint in The List wouldn't affect those regardless.

Since we're on the subject of free spells being overpowered and expensive I'll note that the cream of the crop like [[Endurance]], [[Fury]] and [[Deflecting Swat]] are already selling through good portions of their supply (25-30% over the past month) and prices across the board are all trending up. TCG low, TCG Direct Low, CK Buylist, everything relevant is climbing. Again, no surprises here given that they're some of the most played cards in formats like Modern and EDH and you'd have to be living under a rock to be shocked by this news. Still, I do think it's worth stressing that the cards are objectively some of the best selling, best revenue generating and most reliable specs because there's functionally limitless demand for cards of this caliber.

[EA Veyran, Voice of Duality](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/236608?Language=English&Printing=Normal) and [Foil 2X2 Animar, Soul of Elements](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/276657/magic-double-masters-2022-animar-soul-of-elements?Language=English&Printing=Foil&page=1) are a couple examples of popular Commanders with thin supply and fantastic TCG Direct premiums and sellers should absolutely be looking to capitalize on these kinds of opportunities when they see them. These aren't spikes or buyouts or anything either, it's organic demand + natural drain and the sales and buylists reflect that. EDH is mostly a North American format so don't worry about reinventing the wheel and focus on giving people what they want.

[Hidden Gibbons](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/6325/magic-urzas-legacy-hidden-gibbons?Language=English&page=1)'s stock is evaporating presumably because it's an auto-include in Kibo decks. I kind of buy this as a spec because it's a playable 1 drop that will functionally always be active by the time you jam Kibo so even if a 4/4 is mostly trinket text in EDH you'll take any reasonable 1 CMC body that you can get. After all, Kibo already does a fantastic job of beefing up your team into relevant threats so quantity > quality. Otherwise it's the same old story of single printing, ancient, low print run set, yadda yadda yadda. The fact that [Ravenous Baboons](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/4381/magic-exodus-ravenous-baboons?Language=English) is actually selling at ~$8 blows my mind and tells me that there could be some legs to this spec.",76,0.9,31,mtgfinance,2022-12-31,0,reddit

10jke40,"Foil Guilty Conscience, Crystalline Crawler, Inexorable Tide, Surge Foil Biophagus, Surge Foil Resurrection Orb, Surge Foil Commissar Severina Raine",True,"[[Guilty Conscience]] + [[Phyrexian Vindicator]] is a pseudo infinite damage combo and while I personally don't think it's very good it might make Guilty Conscience foils move. Not very high on this one, not buying any myself, I'm in the ""wait and see"" camp until I see some significant movement. Nonfoils could theoretically move too obviously but supply is so deep and I don't expect organic demand to be high enough to somehow eat through the thousands of copies listed on TCG and sitting in boxes/binders/closets. I expect to see mostly bag holders for these.

[[Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus]] has cemented the abundance of Proliferate love in ONE which makes me pretty high on cards like [[Crystalline Crawler]] and [[Inexorable Tide]] that have relatively low supply, decent prices and that will be/are staples in numerous shells. I also think that Surge Foil [[Biophagus]] is underpriced given how expensive regular copies already are. It's a staple in [[Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]] decks and Atraxa players love to bling out their lists so I could see it moving sometime in the near future.

Another Surge Foil that I'm very high on from ONE spoilers is [[Resurrection Orb]] because it's must-have for [[Kemba, Kha Enduring]] EDH. It basically renders your (Voltron) Commander unkillable to generic removal spells/damage/Wraths/etc. by constantly reviving and reequipping itself. The card was already popular and had low supply so this is a ""good spec getting better"" sort of thing. Seems like a home run.

Another Surge Foil that's selling extremely well, that has low supply and that's cheap relative to its nonfoil counterpart is [[Commissar Severina Raine]]. This is mostly because she's in 60% of [[Isshin, Two Heavens as One]] decks who is consistently a Top 5 weekly Commander as listed on EDH Rec. This meant that her supply has already been steadily draining from the start because (together) they quickly drain the table out even in EDH.

10a4ejo,mvpsportsandmore compleat editions $60,True,"""Market Notes: Wave1 allocations were about as expected/similar to previous years' 'Gift' bundles. However demand for these Compleat editions has so far been a fair bit higher than Gift bundles, so we're sending this first flash alert first to buyers who already preordered (any other Phyrexia One SKU). i.e. just in case there is a sellout those buyers will have a slight advantage.  Of note is that this is a 'first' of its kind, and WOTC typically liked to try to make sure a 'first' has a good showing on the market, which usually means attempting to slightly underprint projected demand. However this historical observation is in direct conflict with their recent D&D statement: “(its) really under monetized”, which also sums up their current approach to MTG i.e. overprint.

So in the end, did they/will they over or under print the Compleat version? Probably initially targeted a slight underprinting, but if big sales appear on their Amazon reports that print button may get set to autopilot like everything else. -MVPD""

104p4ov,Amazon.de has priced DMR quite competitively,True,"I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and I've noticed the love/hate relationship with Amazon.com for various reasons. I try to catch good deals on boxes for me and my playgroup and I would sometimes look at European Amazons just in case they have good prices because Czech shops are usually overpriced. I sometimes order from Games Island because they have good deals and even with shipping it's still affordable and cheaper than ordering from Czech shops.

I haven't seen any good deals on European Amazons (except 2X2 collector boxes on Amazon.es and my order ended up cancelled) until DMR. I've grabbed prices from Amazon.de, Games Island, Cardmarket, and I also included my prices because of a higher VAT in the Czech Republic.

DMR seems like a fine pickup from Amazon.de (free shipping) at the moment, Games Island offers free shipping from a certain amount and Cardmarket prices shippping based on value/weight of the box.

Amazon.de also offers the pre-order price guarantee like Amazon.com - the buyer is charged the lowest price during their pre-order period before it ships, Games Island charges when ordering.

This post is not meant as any advertisement for Amazon, we don't get much European finance threads and I'm just curious to see if Amazon.de will start pricing more aggressively from now on.

10fgmyw,"ONE specs - Summoner's Pact, Ground Rift, Grand Crescendo, Ichor Rats, Myr Turbine, Atraxa, Praetors' Voice, Skittles, Contagion Engine",True,"Lots of awesome spoilers over the past few days and now that we have both The List and the Commander decks fully revealed this is when I like to start spec'ing on new sets. Lots of cards to cover/discuss and people should feel free to add their own. Figured it would be easier to make a single thread than a bunch of individual ones but I'm sure I missed plenty of awesome specs.

[Nesting Grounds](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/269416/magic-commander-streets-of-new-capenna-nesting-grounds?Language=English) will be an auto-include in all 5 Dominus decks as a way to move around those Indestructibility counters and only has 2 printings. Great card to watch if they prove to be popular Commanders as opposed to merely cards in the 99. Too much supply for me to go out and purchase any but definitely a card that I'm keeping tabs on.

[[Venerated Rot Priest]] looks like a potential Infect/Combo contender in Modern and if the Combo version of the deck takes off the key cards would be things like [[Summoner's Pact]], [[Ground Rift]] and maybe even [[Underworld Breach]]. Still too early to tell, waiting on Spike/Mengu/Sam Black/etc. to lead us to the promised land, but it's a good card to be keeping tabs on for potential specs.

""White Tokens matter"" is a prevalent theme in the set and two popular and powerful cards that dodged reprints include [[Grand Crescendo]] and [[Anointed Procession]]. Numerous decks are going to windmill slam both without blinking so I like snagging these if you need them. Crescendo is honestly way too cheap, it's been trending on CK's Hotlist Buylist for a while now, and this will probably get people to stop sleeping on it.
 
Rats/Poison/Corrupted are popular themes and so I fully expect Foil [Ichor Rats](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/36233/magic-scars-of-mirrodin-ichor-rats?Language=English&Printing=Foil&page=1) (nonfoils are reprinted in the Azan Commander deck), [[Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon]] and [[Contagion Engine]] to do very well moving forward. Again, they're fantastic additions to numerous Commanders/shells that should move like water for the next few months. I'm also pretty high on [[Inexorable Tide]] but the Poison deck isn't Blue which puts a slight damper on it. Still expect it to sell well though.

[[Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]] has always been one-of-if-not-the-most popular Commanders and since we now know that she's excluded from The List she's almost certainly going to move in the new Poison/Proliferate/Planeswalker set. Version doesn't really matter, 2XM and SLD should both do fine, the card basically does all of the work for you since the organic demand for it is through the roof.

[[Urtet, Remains of Memnarch]] in an insanely powerful new Myr Commander and many of the ""Myr matters"" cards are single print from ancient sets ala [[Myr Galvanizer]], [[Myr Propagator]], [Myr Reservoir](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/36365/magic-scars-of-mirrodin-myr-reservoir?Language=English), [[Myr Turbine]], [[Myr Matrix]] and [[Myr Incubator]]. I have to imagine that there's all going to be auto-includes and none of them were featured in the The List so if Urtet moves so will most of them. We're probably also going to see cards like [[Kinan, Bonder Prodigy]] and [[Simic Ascendancy]] move but those will be tougher to predict. I say predict but I really mean ""guess."" I do expect this card to be extremely popular and move a ton of cardboard though. It's so powerful and flavorful and fun.

Another obvious pick that works with tokens, Oil counters, Poison, Planeswalkers, etc etc etc is the ever-popular [Doubling Season](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/214841/magic-double-masters-doubling-season?Language=English) and to a lesser extent [Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/230135/magic-kaldheim-vorinclex-monstrous-raider?Language=English). Again, these cards just work with everything that the new set is doing and will undoubtedly see some love. I know Vorinclex is getting a reprint in ONE but it doesn't seem like it a significant one.

What are other people thinking in terms of specs? Seems like one of the better sets that we've had in a while in terms of buying cheap bricks of desirable cards.",31,0.8,44,mtgfinance,2023-01-18,0,reddit

10ker75,I made a Google Sheet for tracking value of (casual) collections,True,"As a casual player (i.e. I don't own my own store, don't make many specs, spend <$1000 per year), I was interested in tracking the value of my collection, but didn't want to pay for services like MTGEcho and wanted to customize what I was tracking. I was interested in a few things specifically: 

1. From the sealed purchases I was making, how much value was I recovering in card value? 
2. Are the singles I was buying going up or down in price? 
3. How much money am I spending on any given set? 
4. How much was I *really* losing on MTG if I decided to sell my collection at a set % of TGC value (e.g. 70% of market)?

I'm also a collection freak so I like cataloguing things, and don't mind putting in a little work every time I open a pack. **So I created this spreadsheet in Google that could do all of that:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zeRhHL2R6K8SXpxiXJDteC4dMIZLWYsnwELa9X7KH6A/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zeRhHL2R6K8SXpxiXJDteC4dMIZLWYsnwELa9X7KH6A/edit?usp=sharing)

How do you use it? Simple:

1. When I open a pack, I enter how much I spent on sealed, as well any opened cards worth $1 or more (or that I expect will one day be >$1) into the Sealed tab. 
2. When I buy singles, I enter them into the Singles tab. 
3. The formulas do the rest!

How does the spreadsheet work? It uses Scryfall's API, which is imported using the ImportJSON Google Sheet formula. When you enter a card into the sheet, along with the defined criteria (foil, etched, borderless, extended art, etc.), it calls all the info on that card in a separate tab (that's the ""Sealed Data"" and ""Singles Data"" tabs). A query will grab the relevant price. 

Tips for using it: 

1. Duplicate the sheet so you can edit it. 
2. Follow my instructions in the notes in the sheet itself, which are in headers for columns that require data entry. I put in some example cards from BRO and 2X2 as well. 
3. I created a handy ""Set Summary"" tab, where you can enter the set code of a set and see a full summary of singles/sealed purchased for that set and how much those cards are worth, along with a few other factors. In that tab is also an overall summary. Test it with BRO or 2X2 using the examples I have in there. 
4. **The biggest issue right now**: Putting in a lot of requests into Scryfall's API can result in a small percentage showing up as errors. These will show up red in the entry tabs. The solution is to delete those errors in the Data sheets and undo it, just giving the formula a chance to do it again. But it's a little annoying - I'd appreciate ideas to help with that. 
5. This really only works if you're not pulling in tons of new cards, it would get pretty tiring otherwise. As it stands, the sheet only goes to a certain number of cards, after that you'll have to add rows and copy and paste the formulas. 
6. Even if you don't want to track your entire collection, it works kind of nicely to check different versions of cards, faster than making separate searches on TCGPlayer. For example, I have Scalding Tarn from MH2 in the Singles sheet as an example - put an x in the columns for foil, extended art, retro frame, and etch to quickly get the prices of any specific MH2 Tarn.

I hope there are at least a few folks out there who'd get some use out of this; I combed the sub for a while and while some folks mentioned how Scryfall's API *could* be used for this, I haven't come across a real example of it. This was a real labor of love, and on top of that I don't know much about APIs or spreadsheets, so had to learn a ton from scratch. As such, a lot of the formulas and layout aren't as efficient as I'm sure they could be. I'd love to hear suggestions for improvements!",30,0.79,23,mtgfinance,2023-01-24,0,reddit
103ewpf,Mark answer player saying magic is making over a billion...,True," **Magic player:**

Mark I'm gonna be real with you, every time we tell you that we have  concerns with the volume of product being release, your response thus  far has been ""We hear you, but get used to it."" I realize that you are  contractually obligated to refrain from voicing any concerns you might  have about the current release cycle (since that would hurt sales) but  it comes off as aloof and glib, like you don't have to care what we  think because you think we'll buy whatever you produce anyway. I'd  honestly prefer if you didn't say anything about it at all.

**( Wotc Legal team answering for ) Mark:**

Much  of Magic’s success over the years has come from us trying new things.  Most of the time those new things were initially met with a lot of  concern. Change is fundamentally scary. 

It’s always been my job  to explain why we’re doing what we’re doing. I’m not trying to be aloof  or glib. I’m trying to be straight forward with all of you. I’m giving  you the behind-the-scene glance at what we’re up to. 

The majority  of the time, the new idea pans out to work well for the game, but not  always. Sometimes, we try something and it fails. When that happens, we  adjust and try something else. We’re a business. We have no motivations  to do things that don’t work. 

If our current approach is  fundamentally flawed, that will come out, and I promise you we’ll do  something different. The metric of success though won’t be volume of  internet chatter. It will be all the metrics we look at (play numbers,  sales numbers, digital numbers, social media metrics, market research,  etc.) 

So far, for the last three years, the metrics have not just  been good, but the best we’ve ever seen. This year Magic made over a  billion dollars (something we’ve never done before). 

And I work many years into the future. I’m super proud and excited about all the amazing Magic designs coming your way.

None  of this is to say that I’m ignoring what people are saying. I hear that  many are voicing that there’s too much product being made. That’s why I  made my post. To explain why there’s so much product. It’s not being  done without careful thought. We want Magic to be healthy, not just for  the present, but for the future.

I am sharing this with you because I see people constantly posting that they purchase forever stamps to lower their future shipping costs. Well, how about a way to lower your current postage costs by 25-33%?

The deal is that your local stamp dealer will likely sell you unused face value postage stamps for 66-75% of face value. The stamps need to still have the adhesive on the back.

The downside is that you'll be acquiring mostly 10c, 20c, and 33c stamps and you'll need to use a sponge/water to apply the stamps, but if you're shipping every week multiple times, you'll save so much money it beats paying retail.

I used to get my stamps from a local stamp shop and he charged me 66% of face value, you could probably get a similar rate if you negotiate buying a large amount of stamps at once.",30,0.84,17,mtgfinance,2023-01-18,0,reddit

As a lover of M:tG since 1996: super duper fun to see all the nostalgia with new art. The packs did vary in the box quite a bit, only with the Target packs did it start looking repetitive. 

I do wish I could have opened them with friends and played with them right away but I have a draft box of it to do that so that will be fun. 

How is it going for others out there?

10cpgkd,What's your personal top 3 for best sealed products atm?,True,"Hey everyone, i wanted to discuss everyone's impressions on the best sealed products to hold as of today, 15th of January 2023. Bias disclaimer : i hold regular limited events, so of course i lean towards draft boxes, i am Europe based, and i hold a good amount of MH2 boxes myself.


Here is my top 3:


1. Modern Horizons 2 draft boxes : The best moment to buy these was likely in the last three months of 2022, as a last print wave brought the price down to historical lows (Games Island even started selling them at 166 at one point, straight up bonkers). Still, the second best moment is right now, while the price still hovers between 190 and 210 shipped. Boots on the ground, i can guarantee the demand for MH2 drafts (at a reasonable price) is absolutely still there, even if LGSs stopped holding them a good while ago.
Also, if the trajectory is anything like the first Modern Horizons set, we won't see a meaningful amount of reprints until the 2024 Masters set, leaving a generous Window for growth in the value of both sealed and singles.  


2. Warhammer 40k Commander decks: especially as a whole set, available for <170 Euros as of time of writing, these are another slam dunk. These will be in demand pretty much until either WH40K or MTG stop being a thing, and while there's no telling how long the print run will be, the current price is already pretty reasonable all things considered. Also, while i'm not a fan of non easily reprintable designs as a player, it's pretty much undeniable that as a collector it does make the product more uppealing.


3. Kamigawa: Neon Dinasty draft boxes : again, another product still very much in demand from the limited community, which is slowly climbing up, despite still being in print. There's a small caveat, in that the many Standard and Pioneer playable cards make it a prime target for challenger decks reprints, but the community's response to Kamigawa's return was so warm and positive that even those probably wouldn't impact the long run growth of sealed product. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a similar situation to OG Dominaria, were community positivity and the appreciation of the limited crowd push boxes well beyond what we would expect for a premier set.


Also, i think there are some sets currently still being slept on, namely:


1. Streets of New Capenna, both draft AND set boxes
2. Ikoria, for somewhat similar reasons
3. Ravnica Alligience


If anyone's interested i can go more in depth into why i hold these opinions, although you can probably deduce that it's because of the value currently present at rare.

10irqt5,"Sealed Spec Sunday - Etched Tokyo Lands, ONE Compleat Bundles, W40K CE",True,"Hey everyone [@Prid3MTG](https://twitter.com/Prid3MTG) here with my top picks sealed picks for the weekend. I know that sealed tends to get a lot of hate (rightfully so more often than not) but every now and then there's a few standouts that show promise.

First up is the Tokyo Lands SLD, both [Regular](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/275805/magic-secret-lair-drop-series-secret-lair-drop-the-tokyo-lands?Language=English) and [Etched](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/275804/magic-secret-lair-drop-series-secret-lair-drop-the-tokyo-lands-etched-foil?Language=English) but mostly Etched since regulars already pushing close to 40. The Tokyo lands are all selling incredibly well with the regular versions of the individual lands (the lands, not the drop itself) having all sold through between 47%-57% of their TCG supply since last week. Yes, all 5 of them. This tells me that they're not only extremely popular but that the drop was also massively under-ordered given the realized demand and so I'm bullish on its long-term growth potential. I do expect Etched to significantly outperform Regulars in a year or so keep that in mind. Don't buy regulars at 38 off of TCG or anything, only grab some if you can find them for substantially less.

The next is [ONE Compleat Bundles](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Phyrexia-Exclusive-Accessories/dp/B0BJ7MPSWS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=682GE84SNVVX&keywords=compleat+bundle+mtg+one&qid=1674414609&sprefix=compleat+bundle+mtg+one%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-1) which are already looking like a homerun product if you ask me. The most important piece of information that you need to know about these Bundles is that they come with a pack that contains 10 Raised Oil Slick basic lands and 2 Raised Oil Slick Mythics which is a frame that you cannot open anywhere else. This is compounded by the fact that ONE's Mythic suite is absolutely mind-blowing in terms of power/value with the only 2-3 misses being Lukka, Jace and maybe Nahiri. All the others are total bangers which means that **you are incredibly likely to open 2 highly desirable Mythics in a stunning frame that cannot be found anywhere else.** Moreover, the Raised Oil Slick basics are gorgeous and are already churning at ~$5.00 a pop which already represents a good amount of value. Toss in 12 set boosters, 20 Phyrexianized lands and more and this screams ""no brainer."" Clearly there's no crystal balls or guarantees in the speculation game but if you ever wanted to gamble on cracking sealed you won't get confidence much higher than this. I personally expect it to be one of the best sealed products of the entire year.

Lastly, [W40K CE](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/272322/magic-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-commander-deck-display-collectors-edition?Language=English) is my pick for the highest upside sealed product currently available on the market. These are essentially 110 card Secret Lair Drops in which every card has the potential for growth and where there's no threat of a direct reprint for most of the creatures and spells. Moreover, even if we do eventually see Universes Within reprints of these cards in The List (e.g. the Street Fighter ""reprints"" included in ONE) we've yet to see them printed in Foil. I won't discount the possibility that one day, years from now we see foil, in-Universe versions of cards like [[Sceptre of Eternal Glory]] but even then I still wouldn't expect it to have a significant impact on the price. While it's currently not worth your time to buy, crack and flip these I also expect that to change once the W40K cards are added to MTGO sometime in the next 2 months since WOTC already stated that this was slated for Q1 of 2023. When that happens the price of cards like [[Triumph of Saint Katherine]], [[Mawloc]], [[Chaos Defiler]], [[Canoptek Scarab Swarm]], [[Poxwalkers]] and more could all experience tremendous gains as Legacy players scramble to acquire copies for their decks. In that sense I see this as preparation for a (soon to come) future where many of these cards are significantly more valuable and cheap CE sets are gobbled up.",22,0.76,26,mtgfinance,2023-01-22,0,reddit

10a8i3s,The future about old foils,True,"Most old frame foils printed in recently are pretty bad. The quality difference between actual old frame foil and modern version is significant. However things are changed in DMR CB, the old frame foil in DMR is exceptional. They are at least on par if not better than old ones. I understand the first prints still hold their premier, but demand is dwindling. If the quality are the same, the pictures are the same, the frame are the same, how many people are willing to pay 30x price for the old one ? At the end, they may only have a hollow price.

108czvw,Thoughts and input on a bulk box for the dirt-mall.,True,"I have been selling/buying/trading cards for almost 3 years and have 3.5k sales on eBay and enjoy it. I started doing it for fun when I was in sales and it progressed. I now sell more than cards on there, but mostly cards. I’ve also been a trader/collector from birth(thanks to mom)and I enjoy hunting down many other things besides cards, so my wife encouraged me to just work for myself and run a store. I’m now setup at the Flea Market(dirt mall) with a permanent booth. I’ve been selling all kinds of shit, but only deck boxes as far as card stuff until I get cases and such in a month or so. Here is where I need the input, I was thinking about doing a big 3-5000 ct bulk box once I convert to a more card/comic focused shop. 

Basically, I usually buy list anything under $2 because it’s not worth listing and shipping and paying fees in my world. So I wanted to know if I had bulk rares and mythics in with commons and uncommons, what would be a fair price to you? 2 for $1 4for$1 ?

I plan on having a separate box for lands. I have lands from every block, obviously I won’t put any ABU lands in there, but everything else is fair game. Would 10 for $1 be good on that? 

I figured at $2, I eat a  30 cent flat fee on eBay and then 12% fees(24cents) and then soon-to-be 60 cents to ship it.  So I can still make a little off a $2 card, so I’m hesitant to go 4for$1, but I’m wondering if 2 for $1 isn’t exciting. I’m probably going to go in the middle to be honest, but I’ve seen some good ideas on this sub, mixed in with the crazy ideas, so I thought I would ask.

As an example I am specifically interested in the 3/2 shapeshifter token created by [[black market connections]] I cannot find other printings of a similar token since I don’t know how to search for them easily. I think that card is going to increase in popularity and I’m wondering if correlation with the tokens pricing exists, or if these have been printed over a million times etc.

10ati5i,DMR Singles - Your buy in price,True,"Hey Everyone. I was just curious what your personal buy in price are for singles in DMR. Specifically FoW, the Tutors, Entomb, Urza, Sylvan Library, etc. This morning they seem to be getting pretty low as the race to the bottom is in full force, but do you think they'll go lower over release weekend? I'm curious to hear everyone's opinion. Thank you!!

Edit: for financial transparency and so know one thinks I'm trying to ""get one over on you""

FoW: I hope they hit $50 but I don't know of thay will happen and was curious about others opinions. 
Tutors: I think Vampiric will hit $25 maybe less. Enlightened I could see hitting $12-$15 but again, I'm just curious about others opinions. Worldy/mystical I have already bought a few around the $7 mark. I am hoping they hit $5 of less.
Entomb: already between $10-$12. Hoping this will hit $7, again just curious about your opinions. 
Urza: Already at $30 or less. Honestly not a card I care about but was just curious how low you think it will hit.
Sylvan Library: around between $23-$25. Maybe could drop under $20 not sure, just curious about everyone's opinion. 

For further transparency, I have bought 1 draft box that I planned to keep sealed. I already own at least 1 copy of every card printed in this set that I would want. Seperately, I am a co-owner of an altered art company. I don't wish to advertise the name because I believe that is against the rules of this group. I wasn't posing this question to get ""insider sepulative information"" or for any nefarious reason. I have been buying and selling for over 10 years and I remember with Double Masters 2022, release day morning put up some of the lowest pricing in those cards when before I would notice the prices would continue to drop (even if not much) over the course of release week.

How do you imagine the market will look in 10 years?


With $1B of new card sales a year, will anyone care about any of the cards being printed now in 10 years?  There will be exceptions that are still collectable, but is there any real expectation that boxes of modern sealed products or the bulk of modern cards will have any value when we are awash in shiny new cards?


With people that remember and played with the ABU old school releases already hitting their peak buying years, are new players actually going to be interested in classic cards?  I mean, is my son going to be as excited about betas, never having played them?  I'm willing to pay a premium for a beta icy manipulator because that was a friend's nickname for his then girlfriend - but absent these associations will most new players care?


What will the market for cards look like if the price bubble collapses or if liquidity drops dramatically?  It's great fun to collect and rediscover magic cards when the prices are rising rapidly, but what happens after a year of having this subreddit full of tales of woe and inability to sell collections.  I have a hard time imagining that the boom years will continue and I can only imagine that it will be hard for the market to rebound enough after a downturn that people will get excited about paying top dollar for alpha lands (that seem to be driven only by an investment mindset rather than nostalgia or playability) and the like again.

I love cracking packs and see sales on Amazon for older boxes and on tcg player that the market price for stuff is low for certain boxes but can never find anything even close to those prices here in Canada. Even after converting the currency the prices don't seem to add up. 

For example if we look at Baldurs Gate collector boxes; they are selling for $130-140 USD and here in Canada I can't find them for under $320. With conversion boxes SHOULD be around $190 CAD but they are twice that. What gives? We also can't buy from Amazon (third party sellers not counted)

When collection buying, there's always the additional niceties that come along with the cards themselves. I'm talking about the following and obviously used/opened:

* Card sleeves (e.g. Dragonshield) - not penny sleeves

* Card sheets (e.g. 3x3, 9 pockets)

* Fat pack boxes

* d20 spin downs

* Instruction books (e.g. card spoilers that came with fat packs)

* other stuff I haven't listed (suggestions welcome!)

10h3lkh,Product/Consumer Impact of Poor Quality Control,True,"A few QC issues I’ve experienced recently have made me reflect on the impacts of poor QC for MTG products/ consumers.

Here’s what I’ve encountered:

- A pack-fresh [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] with a corner crumpled like a rawhide chew toy

- A double shipment of the 30th Anniversary Countdown SL (no doubt a bonus, but I felt responsible at least to report it to Wizards)

- A sealed DMR booster box with ONE rares in the retro slot (a now well-known surprise, but still different from the product I thought I was buying)

Before NEO and the breakneck pace of releases, including a more complex offering with each release, I never encountered these issues. They affect everything from the collector experience to the Limited play experience and even to the customer service experience. They absolutely affect the MTG brand image. Why should I buy sealed MTG when I have no confidence in what the product will contain?

Correcting these problems requires resources for Wizards—both human resources to field support inquiries and physical resources in the form of product replacements. This all costs money. It may take several years of brand equity erosion for Wizards to realize negative financial results, too…

… But when will this massive machine realize that it’s hurting itself and alienating its consumers by trying to scale faster than it’s able?

About seven years ago my son got into Pokemon.  We'd buy packs, and I'd sell duplicates on TCGPlayer to make some of the money back.  I quickly realized that there was a bottom price to what I could sell without losing money.  Since then my son has moved onto MtG and we now have thousands of bulk cards that are below that cut off.  We aren't making money as sellers right now, but are stemming losses.  I've long wanted to begin flipping collections and join TCG Direct (I already have approval to do it whenever I want), and thought that it would be worth listing our bulk alongside our more valuable cards.

zz950m,Opportunity: Transformers: Optimus Prime vs. Megatron Foil Edition,True,"The foil version of the secret lair is 39.99, and it's double-sided foil, meaning it's going to be less of a pringle based on my experience with double-sided foil cards in crimson vow.  The treatments on each side cancel out the warping by balancing each other to an extent.

Right now on TCG player
Blightsteel Colossus is 50 each regular (110+ foil)
Darksteel Colossus is 10 each regular (20 foil)
Doubling Cube is 15 each regular (70 foil)

The reason I think this is an opportunity is that the secondary value of the 40.00 lair is about five times its asking price.  Based on previous lair behavior in about 12 months after release, the prices will have recovered to 70%+ of the previous market value.

Based on this, how many do you expect to buy?  I'm having a hard time going for more than 10 but part of me wants to go big and get 60.  The sale ends in 6 days and I'll be putting my order in after I hear what people think.

zz8cq3,Time Value of MTG Collections,True,"TLDR: Is there any extant, publicly available data on the composition and lifespan of MTG collections? Clearly, there would be enormous variance here and the data would be hard to gather, but it would be interesting to look at the “time value” of MTG collections in aggregate.

I’ve been playing and collecting MTG for over 20 years, and in that time, I have built and sold at least three complete collections. (I’ve regretted it every time, of course, so I’m doing all I can to keep my current collection). I’ve recently been thinking a lot about how each of those collections has or could have changed in value over time.

Although MTG collections are as disparate as their respective components, and they typically change a lot with time, it would be interesting to gather data on just how collections develop over time and how their value fluctuates. This could produce a profile of sorts for the average collection, to be used as a benchmark in much of the content posted in this sub.

I imagine a service like TCG Player’s or MTG Goldfish’s collection managers are already part of the way there. If a few additional criteria were added to theses platforms (e.g. collection “start dates” and both purchase/sale transactions) and users could opt in to include their data publicly but anonymously, then we might be able to get a fair—and dynamic—picture of what happens to collections over time.

Here’s only one example: Imagine a user who primarily plays Modern and who has started collecting in 2017 were able to upload their collection details to a service like this and the service were  automatically to track the value of the entire collection indefinitely. Not only could this collector see, for instance, the impact of reprints on Modern staples, but aggregate data would help everyone else see the same thing across similar collections. There would of course need to be a strong filtering system.

Disclaimer: I’m just a private collector and have no affiliation with Wizards, online MTG services or LGSs. I would, however, be first in line to share my collection data in this form. I also know that the time value of money is easier to evaluate than this because any given currency is uniform within its economic setting and MTG cards are very different assets.",0,0.5,12,mtgfinance,2022-12-30,0,reddit

Personally, I'm not a fan of the trend towards more abstract art.  As an older player, one of the things I've always loved about Magic was the classic fantasy/realistic style (I'm no art expert so probably using the wrong terms).  Just on that page compare the art for the Jace variants to the art for Blue Sun's Twilight.  Blue Sun art looks awesome, while Jace's black and white Manga look just feels like a different game.

Sure we don't have much to make our determination and predictions on but that's half the fun. 

1. Out of the following announced Magic products announced for release in 2023, which product do you anticipate will be the best from a Magic Finance and speculation perspective? Explain your answer
2. Which of these products do you think will be the worst from a Magic finance and speculation perspective?

**Upcoming 2023 Magic Product Releases** 

* Phyrexia: All Will Be One
* March of the Machine
* Wilds of Eldraine
* Lost Cavers of Ixalan
* The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth
* Doctor Who Commander Decks

**To get the conversation started, here are a few of my thoughts and predictions**:

March of the Machine will be introducing a new card type (Battle), closes out a prominent story arc, is an event set and Mark Rosewater has said it is his most ambitious design ever. I anticipate this set will do a lot of new things that are unprecedented which means a greater chance for balancing and development issues on the higher end of the power spectrum which tends to fair well for good Magic finance for a set. 

The Lord of the Rings set being the first full fledged Universes Beyond set is a major milestone and Wizards has a lot of incentive to ensure this product is successful and well received, especially considering the prominent IP it is using. I anticipate this set will have lots of exciting and elusive showcase treatments and I believe the prominence of the IP could make it desirable as a collectors item from non-Magic players. I also can imagine this set including allied fetchland reprints (which are long overdue for a mass reprint).

I find that when Wizards does something for the first time for a product line that is more innovative, these products tend to be very well received and often have a higher power level and secondary market value (examples include Modern Masters 1, Modern Horizons 1, the first Secret Lair Drops and War of the Spark). Both March of the Machine and The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth seem to meet that criteria.

Wilds of Eldraine I could imagine being the worst target. The original Eldraine had a lot of development issues, so I imagine they will be more conservative and work extremely hard to ensure that doesn't happen again. It's also the set that will follow March of the Machine which I anticipate will have a higher power level and they might want the pendulum to swing in the opposite direction by nerfing the power level of Wilds of Eldraine a bit.",0,0.49,45,mtgfinance,2023-01-23,0,reddit

10g6ucl,Concept Praetors Spec,True,"With each concept praetor appearing in less than 2% of collector boosters. Will there be a large premium on the extremely playable ones such as Sheoldred? It seems the foils would be even rarer as the foil slot is 49% regular extended foil whereas 51% will be the “booster fun”. With that being said the foil concept praetors would only be ~1% per pack. This leaves it at a pretty low chance to get a particular one.

Working with less than 1% chance for a foil per booster compared to 7.4% chance to pull a showcase foil from Dominaria United out of 7 different mythics. This version will be much rarer. With that being said, each praetor is for concept foil is only a 20$ premium from the normal foil and much less of a premium compared to textured foil. Is this card not more rare than the textured foil and still has high demand. I assume this is a good spec.

104jb0m,WotC is now getting backlash D&D Side which could cause a Shake up that effects MtG too,True,"So OGL 1.1 got leaked and it has the D&D community absolutely flipping out, other companies are freaking, this could be even uglier then what is happening MtG side because the fact that it got leaked suggests a civil war in Hasbro/WotC that could spill over into things MtG side, especially if executives start resigning.

 Also this is even more meat for the activist investors who have been pushing for new leadership at WotC and Hasbro at large.

 I'd be surprised if the backlash against WotC doesn't lead to another drop in Hasbros Stock Price.

 Don't know how chaos at WotC will effect the MtG markets yet.

10atc74,Too many reprints?,True,"I’ve been watching the recent videos cracking DMR collectors boxes and I’m wondering, are certain high power cards going to tank in price or lose their uniqueness? 
Most boxes I see an Urza or Yawgmoth and it kinda makes them look like a bulk rare/mythic cards than a specially sought out card and experience. 
If you can get tutors and [[Force of Will]]’s so often then where’s the specialty in that versus a FoW at 1 in 12-15 packs? 
(Throwing numbers out there)

Last year, [[Sensei’s Divining Top]] and [[Concordant Crossroads]] were over 50$ but then they got all of the new treatments and print run and now they are both under 25$. 

If this is the case then what’s to say just wait out your next favorite retro or high end purchase until the next reprint? 
They are gonna do it and you know it.

Lots of speculation that it's going to be a premier GSZ target in Legacy once it gets added to MTGO later this month so people are apparently already stocking up. It's a cheap and effective way to kill things like Mom, Delver and DRC plus it scales well as the game progresses. The exiling never hurts either and is relevant in many MUs.

I wondered whether one can make a gross statement how many weeks after a set release it usually takes for reprinted staples to hit a minimum, before they stabilize or even rise again? 1,2,4, 8,20?

I'm interested in the general pattern if there is any in your experience... I assume, it may depend on whether it's a limited print run.

10il78i,Question as someone who is only looking to collect MTG cards. I don't play and don't trade or look to profit from them.,True,"I'm starting to collect full sets, which I really enjoy looking at and having in binders.

For general set's behavior I've been looking at https://www.mtggoldfish.com/sets and it doesn't seem to vary too much after rotation.

But is there a way to predict the behavior of a single card's price?

I mean like figuring out how many decks in standard use it vs how many decks in modern or eternal formats use it and predict with a good degree of certainty if its price is going to drop or not after standard rotatation?

The card in question which is giving me this headache is Sheoldred, The Apocalypse. It's just too expensive atm for someone who doesn't play the game. I was checking decks with it and some eternal decks use it, but I believe it is mostly being used in Standard, hence my doubts about its price dropping after rotation.

If this is a stupid question, please let me know why. Elucidate my ignorance.

10bh7jc,Why are people sleeping on Unfinity?,True,"Hey yall, I wanna discuss unfinity real quick.  I played a couple drafts and my head is still spinning from all the stickers and attractions.  Pretty fair to say the game play has very little value.  However, I'm here to discuss the financial aspects.  The set has been out for about half a year and the prices of single are pretty stable.  Surprising thing is the EV of this set is off the charts, I have never seen anything like this.  Here are my calc using recent market data.

[Unfinity EV Calc](https://preview.redd.it/jw0akyml8yba1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=794812b40b02e3251a52c9a5619d72c08c8ed3dd)

If I'm not mistaken the price of the box is in the 90-100 range and there is no shortage of supply.  We're talking about a +50% EV on this box.  This isn't even including possible foil hits.  There's a small handful of rares/mythics that has some value and my calc might not be correct but we can easily subtract like 7 dollars and the analysis is unchanged.  Even if you ONLY consider the shock lands it accounts for $79 which I believe is still slightly higher than distributor prices.  If you can sell the lands in this set, you're basically free rolling.

It looks stunning. The text is 'correct', in the sense that the name/type 'pop' above the foil layer.

Combined with great art, I don't see any reason to run a 7th Foil Birds over a DMR, for example.

106c50c,Why Couldn't Magic the Gathering Maintain Stay as Flatout Dominant Leader Of Trading Card Games as Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer Are For Pen and Paper RPGs and Miniature Wargames? Why Had MtG Fallen Down into 1 of the Big 3s of Its Market in a Plurality From Being King of the TCG Format?,True,"As a gigantic fan of Warhammer in addition to playing some DND and MtG in the past (as well as owners of decks of the other Big 2 TCGs Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon), I'm rather wondering about this........

Pretty much today Warhammer and Dungeons and Dragons are the dominant names of their markets the Pen and Paper RPG and Miniature Wargaming. Both have penetrated mainstream enough that more and more players are now normies rather than stereotypical geek and have entered into the consciousness of pop culture to a degree (even if still niche pop culture) as seen in how Warhammer is now so known in the gaming community on top of AAA list celebrities like Henry Cavill openly admitting to playing the game and DND has been referenced in movies and TV shows (enough that a major popular one Stranger Thing has an entire season revolving around the game as a backdrop). Basically its more accurate to describe DND and Warhammer as being the monopoly in their fields that n one else comes close to their market dominance. Its veryt elling that MtG has chosen to crossover with both  franchises.......


Which leads me to wonder..... Why MtG could not hold its former place as King of TCGs? I remember in the 90s Magic was practically the only TCG that even hardcore nerdom could name outside of the dedicated Collectible Cardgame fandom. Even when Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh were first coming out and stealing market share from Wizards of the Coast, Magic still was the go-to for CCGs.

Nowadays Magic has fallen so hard from the top. From being the monopoly leader, now Magic has dropped to being a member of the ""Big 3s"" of TCGs and not even as #1 in  but a distant 3rd in overall popularity in most places and certainly for overall international popularity. Even in North America where it frequents 2nd place, its still a  considerable distance away from current champion Pokemon as far as sales goes and Yu-Gi-Oh ain't to far behind in gap (enough that I read it was only like a 4-5 ratio difference  in revenue from MtG as far as North American profits revealed to the public in one recent website's reporting).

So I gotta ask with Magic is struggling to get ahead and simply remains as a Big 3 in its field in the same way Baseball has fallen from being the sole American sport to Big 3 and also is struggling to reach the heights of its glory days? While DND and Warhammer not only continue to be the leader of their formats but are in practise monopolies of their genre formats? Esp with Games Workshops having dedicated stores across the world for Warhammer and DND having a dedicated online GameCompanion that also acts as Toolset and Marketplace and even community meetup to an extent that MtG lacks?

Where did Magic go wrong in contrast to these two other monopoly leaders of other tabletop format?",0,0.31,40,mtgfinance,2023-01-08,0,reddit
