One result that is apparent, however, is that if Magic: the Gathering Cards can predict Hasbro's stock price, it is through a more complicated model or set of mechanisms than are presented here in this small scope.\n\nAlong the way to this conclusion, several data constraints or other obstacles introduced limitations to the results. These challenges are worth further exploring and present a set of meaningful lessons and in and of themselves.\n\n```{r}\n```\n\n### Data Constraints\n\n```{r}\n# weekly data for magic the gathering\n# magic card data had to be manually collected\n# stocks are influenced by countless macro-economic and micro-economic features, even if magic is a large portion of Hasbro's portfolio, it is a poor proxy variable without a number of other features\n# the volume of sales for magic products, player sentiment, and the supply of cards brought to market would all be helpful variables, but unavailable for one reason or another\n```\n\n### Findings\n\n```{r}\n# Theory of multi-variate analysis improving on ARMA model.\n# Magic cards seemed to play a role in that improvement.\n# Granularity of data is crucial.\n# Pros and Cons of Sealed products as Magic-stand in\n\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"conclusions.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"visual","theme":"lumen","title":"Conclusions"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
